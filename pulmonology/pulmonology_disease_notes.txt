L2: histology and embryology
	main: lung anatomy and embryology
	- respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (give surfactant, steroids, supp O2)
	- sequestration (shares pleura + sytemic arterial supply)


L3: overview of lung pathology
	main: overview of some basic lung pathologies
	- asthma (bronchospasm + airway remodeling)
	- chronic bronchitis + bronchiolitis (mucus hypersecretion)
	- bronchiectasis (bronchi+ole dilation + muscle/elastic destruction)
	- emphysema (airsac destruction + elastic loss)
		- proximal (centrilobular, centriacinar) --- smoking
		- panacinar (entire acinus) --- recessive
		- distal (septal, pleural, localized) --- spontaneous pneumothorax
		- irregular (irregular acinus involvement ) --- scarring from inflammation

	- pneumonia --- infection
		- bronchopneumonia (lobular) - spots
		- lobar - whole lobe
	- edema
	- hemorrhage
	- adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	- diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)

			- mycobacteria tuberculosis
		- non-infectious
	- pulmonary embolism
	- pulmonary hypertension


L4: physiology I: physiology and pathophysiology
	main: fundamental lung gas exchange + ventilation contro
	- CO2 perfusion limited, O2 + CO diffusion limited
	- alveolar ventilation = minute vent - dead space vent (~150 ml)
	- air bullae
	- alveolar ventilation = K / PaCO2
	- CO2 narcosis
		- increased CBF, intracranial pressure
		- tremor, confusion, respiratory depression, coma, death
	- vent control
		- pons - penuomotaxic center - inspiratory "off switch"
		- medullary rhythmicity area:
			- dorsal respiratory group - inspiratory - sets RR
			- ventral respiratory group - expiratory


L5: physiology II: oxygen and gas exchange
	main: fick equation and alveolar gas exchange equation
	- fick equation: Vgas = Surface Area / Thickness of membrane * Gas Solubility(Palveoli - Pvein)
	- hemoglobin curve (think muscle use -> right shift in muscle to grab more O2):
		- H+ causes right shift
		- hyperthermia causes right shift
		- PCO2 causes right shift
		- 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) causes right shift
	- alveolar gas equation: PaO2 = (Patm - Ph20) x FiO2 - PaCO2 / R
		- R = .8
		- (Patm - Ph20) x FiO2 ~ 150 on room air


L6: physiology III: V/Q mismatch and respiratory mechanics

	- A-a gradient
		– v/q mismatch
		– shunt (an extreme of v/q mismatch)
			- hypoxemic vasoconstriction - low PaO2 veins get constricted
		– diffusion problems
	- normal A-a gradient
		– pure hypoventilation
		- low PiO2


L7: physiology IV: respiratory mechanics and PFTs
	main: spirometry and volume testing, DLCO testing, fixed volume ventilation
	- elastance = rebound force = 1 / compliance
	- compliance = Δvolume / Δpressure
	- lung inflation hysteresis
		- more pressure to open "snap", surfactant keeps open

	- obstructive volume defect
		- FEV1 / FVC < .7
		- equal pressure point - collapse point
		- types:
			- variable extrathoracic - expiration flattened
			- variable intrathoracic - inspiration flattened
			- fixed - inspiration and expiration flattened
	- residual volume defect - FVC decreased but FEV1 / FVC fine

	- PFTs:
		- spirometry - FEV1 (forced expiratory volume @ 1s) + FVC (forced vital capacity)
		- lung volumes
			- total lung capacity (TLC)
		- diffusing capacity - DLCO

	- ventilators:
		- compliance = plateau pressure - PEEP (positive end-expiratory  pressure)
		- peak pressure - peep = flow x resistance + Δ Volume / compliance
		- side effects:
			- hypotension (from reduced venous return)
			- vent induced injuries - from high volume or high FiO2
			- pneumothorax
			- gas-trapping, auto PEEP
			- increased dead space
			- increased shunt

		- inspiratory pause - stop flow - ΔP no longer depends on airway resistance
			- plateau pressure - peep = ΔP = tidal volume / compliance
