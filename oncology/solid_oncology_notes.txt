L12: prostate cancer
	main:
	- epidiomiology:
		- most common male cancer (27%)
		- 2nd most common male cancer death (11%)
		- 11% lifetime risk
		- 3% lifetime death risk
		- median age 66
		- most common 65-74 ages
	- risk factors:
		- familial risks (2x per first degree relative)
		- BRCA: 1 -> 2x, 2->5x

	- screening:
		- prostate specific antigen (PSA)
			- glycoprotein: liquefys semen
			- cutoff: 4 ng/ml
				- sens: 21%, 51% for gleason >= 8
				- spec: 91%
			- false positives: BPH, prostatitis, ejaculation, urinary retention
		- controversial, only test 55-69
	
	- histology:
		- prostate:
			- lobular glands + ducts
				- basal layer: cubuoidal
				- luminal cells: columnar secretory
			- fibromuscular stroma around glands
		- gleason grading:
			- higher worse
			- add 1st and 2nd cell population scores
			- grading:
				- 3: lots of glands, differing sizes
				- 4: glands fuse, no lumens
				- 5: no gland differentiation
			
			- risk:
				- <=6: low risk
				- 7: medium risk
				- >=8+: high risk

	- pathology:
		- adenocarcinomas:
			- occur in peripheral zone
			- infiltrative, crowded glands
			- large nuclei + nucleoli
			- basal cell layer missing

		- benign prostatic hyperplasia:
			- 20% men at 40
			- 70% men at 60
			- partial or complete urethral obstruction
			- only in transitional zone: around urethral start by bladder

	- symptoms:
		- 80% asymptomatic
		- 20%: urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, hematuria, bone pain

	- biopsy: 12 cores, transrectal US guided
	
	- treatment:
		- localized:
			- surgery (prostatectomy):
				- risks:
					- ED - 43% at 2 years
					- incontinence: 15% at 2 years
			- radiation:
				- risks similar to surgery
				- external beam:
					- low risk for incontinence
				- brachytherapy: radioactive seeds
			- active surveillance:
				- less risks, but similar to surgery
				- PSA every 3 mo
		
		- metastatic:
			- hormonal therapy:
				- androgen deprivation therapy (ADT):
					- testosterone < 50 ng/ml
					- GnRH agonists: goserelin, leuprolide
						- result in downregulation of LH/FSH
					- antiandrogen: bicalutamide
						- for initial GnRH androgen flare
				- orchiectomy:
					- quick, cost effective

			- castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC):
				- prostate cancer -> CRPC after ~2 years of ADT
				- metastatic lethal form
				- treatment:
					- docetaxel (anti-microtubule)
					- abitarone + prednisone:
						- androgen biosynthesis inhibitor
					- enzaulatamide:
						- androgen antagonist
						- superior to bicalutamide
					- sipuleucel-T:
						- vaccine
						- T-cells targeted against prostatic acid posphatase (PAP)
					- radium 223:
						- targets bone mets
				
				- supportive care:
					- zoledronic acid (bisphosphonates):
						- for bone mets
						- inhibits Ca release from tumors
					- denosumab:
						- anti-RANKL antibody
