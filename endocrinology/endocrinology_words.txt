Clinical Case
• A 37 year old gravida 3, para 3 woman
presented to her physician because she had
difficulty concentrating, weight gain and
difficulty staying warm. She had had severe
blood loss during the birth of her third child 6
months ago and was then unable to lactate,
lost her pubic and axillary hair, had low blood
pressure and generalized fatigue. Her
physician performed some tests in order to
make a diagnosis. What is the cause?

– are not seeking fertility
Hyperprolactinemia: Treatment Goals
• Restore gonadal function
– Improvement in sexual dysfunction
– Fertility
• Resolve galactorrhea (if bothersome)
• Reduce/stabilize tumor size
– Reverse mass effects
– Preserve/restore pituitary function
• Normalize PRL level

Adrenal steroidogenesis
Steroid Hormone Mechanism of Action
• In contrast to the adenylyl cylase and
phospholipase C mechanisms utilized
by peptide hormones and involving
cell membrane receptors and
generation of intracellular second
messengers, the steroid hormone
mechanism involves binding to
cytosolic (or nuclear) receptors that
initiate DNA transcription and
synthesis of new proteins.
• In further contrast to peptide
hormones, which act quickly on their
target cells (within minutes), steroid
hormones act slowly (taking hours).

• Adrenal Crisis
• Summary
Adrenal Cortex:
Zona glomerulosa: Mineralocorticoids
• Mineralocorticoid production is
controlled by the renin-angiotensinaldosterone (RAA) regulatory cycle
• Initiated by the release of renin from
the juxtaglomerular cells in the
kidney, resulting in cleavage of
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in
the liver
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
which binds and activates the
angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1
receptor [AT1R]), resulting in
increased adrenal aldosterone
production and vasoconstriction.
Zona glomerulosa: Mineralocorticoids
• Aldosterone enhances sodium
retention and potassium
excretion, and increases the
arterial perfusion pressure,
which in turn regulates renin
release.
• Because mineralocorticoid
synthesis is primarily under the
control of the RAA system,
hypothalamic-pituitary damage
does not significantly impact
the capacity of the adrenal to
synthesize aldosterone.

Glucocorticoid Production:
Regulation of Glucocorticoid Steroidogenesis:
• Circadian rhythm:
• Cortisol is low in the late evening and
continues to decline in the first
several hours of sleep
• Major secretory episodes begin in the
sixth to eighth hours of sleep
• Stress responsiveness:
• Responsive to physical stress
• Stress responses originate in the
central nervous system and increase
hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH
secretion
• Feedback inhibition:
• By glucocorticoids (both endogenous
and exogenous)
Image from: J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2013 Nov; 132(5): 1033–1044.
Cortisol Secretion
Zona fasciculata: Glucocorticoids
• Originally called this because of their influence on glucose
metabolism
• Bind to specific cytosolic receptors that mediate the actions of these
hormones
• These glucocorticoid receptors are present in virtually all tissues
• Synthetic steroids have greater affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor
and delayed plasma clearance→ increased tissue exposure
• Minimal mineralocorticoid effects
• Cortisol is not the only steroid in the pathway with glucocorticoid
activity→ corticosterone is also a glucocorticoid
Main Targets and Actions of Cortisol
Target Physiologic Function
Liver/Adipose Tissue/Skeletal Muscle
Pancreas
• Increased glucose levels:
• Increased gluconeogenesis
• Inhibits insulin secretion
Immune System • Decreased production of Il-1, Il-6, TNF-α
• Inhibition of inflammation
Kidney
Bone
• Decreased reabsorption of calcium
• Inhibition of collagen synthesis and bone deposition
Skin and Connective Tissue • Antiproliferative for fibroblasts and keratinocytes

• Summary
Adrenal Androgens:
• DHEA and androstenedione are androgenic
steroids produced by the zona reticularis
• These compounds have weak androgenic
activity
• Much lower affinity for the androgen receptor

• Converted in the testes to testosterone
• In males the adrenal androgens are of little
significance→ testes produce their own
testosterone and do not require adrenal
precursors
• In females the adrenal cortex is the major
source of androgenic compounds

• Summary
Adrenal Medulla
• The inner 10–20% of the adrenal gland is the
adrenal medulla → secretes catecholamines.
• The adrenal medulla and the paraganglia are
part of the autonomic/sympathetic nervous
system
• Chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla are
specialized for the synthesis, storage, and
secretion of catecholamines.
• Endocrine and nervous systems are alike in
that each system works by releasing
chemicals (hormones or neurotransmitters)
that bind to cell surface receptors of target
tissues and nerves → thereby causing an
effect
• The catecholamines, like thyroid hormone,
are synthesized from tyrosine
Catecholamines
• Epinephrine→ synthesized mainly in the adrenal medulla
• Norepinephrine→ found in the adrenal medulla + central nervous system +
peripheral sympathetic nerves
• Dopamine→ precursor of NE is found in the adrenal medulla and in
noradrenergic neurons
• It is present in high concentrations in the brain, in specialized neurons in the
sympathetic ganglia, and in the carotid body, where it serves as a neurotransmitter
• Work through alpha and beta receptors
• Increase the rate and force of contraction of the myocardium
• Increase oxygen consumption and heat production

there is concern for ADRENAL
INSUFFICIENCY!
Adrenal Insufficiency:
• The prevalence of permanent adrenal insufficiency is 5 in 10,000 in
the general population.
• Hypothalamic-pituitary origin of disease is most frequent, with a
prevalence of 3 in 10,000
• Primary adrenal insufficiency has a prevalence of 2 in 10,000.
• ~ 1/2 are acquired, mostly caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal
glands
• other 1/2 are genetic, most commonly caused by distinct enzymatic blocks in
adrenal steroidogenesis affecting glucocorticoid synthesis (i.e., congenital
adrenal hyperplasia.)
Adrenal Insufficiency
• Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by diseases of:
• Adrenal gland (primary), low cortisol, high ACTH
• Pituitary gland (secondary), low cortisol, low or normal ACTH
• Hypothalamic
Adrenal insufficiency:

Autoimmune Adrenal Insufficiency
• In the Western world, thought to account for
up to 80% of cases of primary adrenal failure
• Autoimmune process that destroys the
adrenal cortex
• Evidence of both humoral and cell-mediated
immune mechanisms directed at the adrenal
cortex

Primary Adrenal Insufficiency Etiologies:
Infectious Adrenalitis:
• Tuberculous adrenalitis was once the most frequent cause of primary
adrenal insufficiency, still the case in many countries.
• In recent years there has been a resurgence of tuberculous adrenalitis
as a result of the increasing number of patients with AIDS.
• Adrenalitis due to CMV infection is especially common in patients with HIV
• Antifungals may further compromise adrenal function.
Primary Adrenal Insufficiency Etiologies: Tuberculous Adrenalitis:
• TB can destroy the adrenal glands.
• Results from hematogenousspread from active
infection elsewhere in the body.
• Adrenal destruction is gradual: adrenal glands are
usually enlarged by inflammatory cell infiltration
• Adrenal calcifications can be seen in ~50% of
patients.
• Bhatia et al, prospectively looked at 5 patients with
Addison’s secondary to tuberculosis. 2.5 years after
receiving TB treatment 0 of the 5 regained
endogenous glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid
function.
• Recovery possible but rare.

• Risk factors:
• Anticoagulant/heparin therapy
• Hypercoagulable states
• Trauma
• Post-op
• Sepsis
• Without appropriate treatment the patients
will progress to shock and death
• In fact prior to CT scanning adrenal

• Summary
Diagnosis: Adrenal Insufficiency:
• Baseline AM cortisol measurement:
• People with a normal sleep-wake cycle want to take advantage of the fact that cortisol peaks in the
morning!
• Check at 8AM.
• If <10mcg/dL further testing is indicated.
Adrenal Insufficiency
Diagnosis:
• If AM cortisol inconclusive then ACTH
stimulation testing needed
• Give 250mcg of synthetic ACTH(1-24)
(cosyntropin):
• Has same potency as native ACTH(1-39).
• Should be given IV or IM
• Check baseline cortisol and then cortisol
level again either 30 or 60 minutes later
• If peak ≥18mcg/dL then pt does not have
adrenal insufficiency (new data published
in 2021 suggest that 14mcg/dLmay also
be an appropriate cut-off)
• Excludes primary adrenal insufficiency
and most patients with secondary
adrenal insufficiency
Oelkers W. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1992;75:259-264.
Adrenal Insufficiency:
Other diagnostic tests:
• Low dose ACTH stimulation test:
• Done with 1mcg
• Helpful in patients with acute onset secondary adrenal insufficiency
• However the most reliable tests even in patients with recent
secondary AI are insulin-induced hypoglycemia or the metyrapone
test
• Insulin-induced hypoglycemia testing not frequently done
• Metyrapone-inhibits production of cortisol→ stimulates ACTH→stimulates
cortisol
• Very limited availability of this medication
Summary:
Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency:
1) Demonstrate low cortisol secretion:
• Serum cortisol is higher in the early morning
• Low AM suggestive of adrenal insufficiency
• AM cortisol <10 ug/dL
2) Determine whether the cortisol deficiency is:
• Primary adrenal insufficiency: low cortisol and high ACTH
• Secondary or pituitary adrenal insufficiency: low cortisol and low or normal
ACTH
• Evaluate mineralocorticoid secretion in patients with primary adrenal
insufficiency
3) Treat the cause

• Mimic endogenous cortisol rhythm:
Treatment: Chronic Adrenal Insufficiency:
• Lowest glucocorticoid dose that treats underlying deficiency and does not
cause Cushing’s
• Hydrocortisone in 2-3 divided doses is preferred but can also use prednisone
or dexamethasone
• Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency will also require treatment with
fludrocortisone (0.05mg-0.2mg per day) for mineralocorticoid replacement
• Patient should be instructed about the importance of adherence to treatment
and what to do in times of stress
• 2-3x usual dose during times of illness
• If not able to take POs, can do IM injection and go to ED or just go to the ED
• Medic Alert Bracelet
Preventing Adrenal Crisis
● Adrenal crisis is a potentially fatal emergency event in
patients with adrenal insufficiency
● Despite being preventable with appropriate glucocorticoid
treatment, one study following 423 patients with AI saw
four deaths from adrenal crisis in a two year period
● Patient and family education about managing home doses
of glucocorticoids in periods of illness or stress is key to
prevention strategies
○ Even after education, 18% of patients still fail to adjust their
doses
● Patients also need to have bracelets or emergency cards
○ Only 54% of patients in crisis receive glucocorticoids within 30
minutes of a healthcare professional arriving

• Summary
Adrenal Crisis
• Adrenal crisis: acute adrenal insufficiency
• Most common in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency but can happen
when patients have secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency as well
• Pts with primary adrenal insufficiency- major clinical features of crisis are
hypotension and volume depletion from mineralocorticoid deficiency
• With secondary and tertiary insufficiency since there is sufficient
mineralocorticoid usually do not see volume depletion
• May have hypotension due to decreased vascular tone
• May occur when patients are abruptly withdrawn from exogenous
glucocorticoids!
Adrenal Crisis:
• Predominant symptom is shock
• Can have nonspecific symptoms:
• GI: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
• Constitutional: weakness, fatigue, lethargy, fever, confusion or coma
• Biochemical features:
• Hyperkalemia
• Hyponatremia
• Hypoglycemia
• Urgent diagnosis and treatment→but treatment should not be delayed for
diagnosis
Oelkers W. NEJM. 1996;335:1206-1212.
Adrenal Crisis
• Treatment:
• If no prior diagnosis of AdrenaI Insufficiency dexamethasone 4mg IV preferred,
since it does not interfere with testing
• For patients with known Adrenal Insufficiency can give dexamethasone 4mg IV,
hydrocortisone 100mg IV or other high dose steroid
• Replete volume losses with 1-3 L of NS
• Once treatment initiated ACTH stimulation testing can be done

Cushing’s Syndrome
• Cushing’s syndrome reflects a constellation of clinical features that result
from chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids of any etiology
• The disorder can be ACTH-dependent
• pituitary corticotrope adenoma
• ectopic secretion of ACTH by nonpituitary tumor
• ACTH-independent → from the adrenal
• adrenocortical adenoma
• adrenocortical carcinoma
• nodular adrenal hyperplasia
• Can also be iatrogenic→ administration of exogenous glucocorticoids to
treat various inflammatory conditions
• The term Cushing’s disease refers specifically to Cushing’s syndrome
caused by a pituitary corticotrope adenoma
Harrison’s
Cushing’s Syndrome: Epidemiology
• Cushing’s syndrome is generally considered a rare disease.
• It occurs with an incidence of 1–2/100,000 population per year.
• In the overwhelming majority of patients, Cushing’s syndrome is caused by an
ACTH-producing corticotrope adenoma of the pituitary, as initially described by
Harvey Cushing in 1912.
• Cushing’s disease more frequently affects women, with the exception of prepubertal cases,
where it is more common in boys.
• By contrast, ectopic ACTH syndrome is more frequently identified in men.
• Only 10% of patients with Cushing’s syndrome have a primary, adrenal cause of
their disease.
• Most of these patients are women.
• Overall, the medical use of glucocorticoids for immunosuppression, or for the
treatment of inflammatory disorders, is the most common cause of Cushing’s
syndrome.

Adapted from: Greenspan’s Basic and Clinical Endocrinology, 8th edition.
• The most common feature is progressive central
obesity usually involving the face, neck, trunk,
abdomen . The extremities are usually spared, and
may be wasted.
• Loss of subcutaneous connective tissue due to the
catabolic effects of glucocorticoid results in easy
bruising after minimal injury.
• Purple striae occur as the fragile skin stretches due to
the enlarging trunk, breasts, and abdomen
• Osteoporosis is common in patients with Cushing's
syndrome.
• Decreased linear growth in children
• Glucose intolerance is common in Cushing's
syndrome. It is primarily due to stimulation of
gluconeogenesis by cortisol and peripheral insulin
resistance caused by obesity.
• HTN and cardiovascular disease.
• Increased mortality.

• CONFIRMATORY TESTS
• 1 mg overnight dexamethasone

Cushing’s Syndrome: Evaluation

3. Cushing’s Syndrome:
Determine the Cause
• CHECK ACTH!!!
• Differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent cortisol excess.
• Generally, plasma ACTH levels are suppressed in cases of autonomous adrenal cortisol
excess, as a consequence of enhanced negative feedback to the hypothalamus and
pituitary.
• By contrast, patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s have normal or increased plasma
ACTH, with very high levels being found in some patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome.
• Importantly, imaging should only be used after it is established whether the
cortisol excess is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent, because nodules in the
pituitary or the adrenal are a common finding in the general population.
• In patients with confirmed ACTH-independent excess, adrenal imaging is
indicated, preferably using an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.
3. Determine cause:
• ACTH mediated
• Pituitary → Cushing’s Disease
• Ectopic
• NON-ACTH Mediated
• ACTH Low/Suppressed
• Adrenal source:
• Adenoma vs
• Carcinoma vs
• Hyperplasia
• Imaging of Adrenal Glands
• CT scan of the abdomen
• **Exogenous glucocorticoids**
common cause
CHECK ACTH!
Cushing’s Syndrome: Establishing the Cause
Pituitary vs. Ectopic (ACTH-dependent)
• For ACTH-dependent cortisol excess , a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of
the pituitary is the investigation of choice, but it may not show an
abnormality in up to 40% of cases because of small tumors below the
sensitivity of detection.
• Most pituitary corticotrope adenomas still display regulatory features,
including residual ACTH suppression by high-dose glucocorticoids (8mg
dexamethasone suppression).
• In contrast, ectopic sources of ACTH are typically resistant to
dexamethasone suppression.
• However, it should be noted that a small minority of ectopic ACTHproducing tumors exhibit dynamic responses similar to pituitary
corticotrope tumors.
Cushing’s Syndrome: Establishing the Cause
Pituitary vs. Ectopic
• If discordant results, or if there is
any other reason for doubt, the
differential diagnosis can be
further clarified by performing
bilateral inferior petrosal sinus
sampling (IPSS) with concurrent
blood sampling for ACTH in the
right and left inferior petrosal
sinus and a peripheral vein.
Determine the cause:
ACTH mediated
• Ectopic
• Usually bronchial in origin
• Small cell carcinoma of the lung are most common
• Also carcinoid
• Tumors of a wide variety of tissues, usually carcinomas rather than sarcomas
or lymphomas, have been associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome
• Does not suppress to high dose dexamethasone
• Can present with HYPOkalemia
• ACTH and cortisol levels may be very high → leading to mineralocorticoid effect
Treatment:
Cushing’s Syndrome
• Once cause is identified treatment is surgical
• Either adrenalectomy
• Transsphenoidal resection (TSS)
• Resection of the ectopic lesion

localized can consider medical management:
• Ketoconazole→ inhibits early steps of steroidogenesis
• Metyrapone→ inhibits 11β-hydroxylase

• Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC)
• Summary
Catecholamine-secreting tumors
• Pheochromocytomas: a tumor arising from
adrenomedullary chromaffin cells that
commonly produces one or more
catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. Rarely, these tumors are
biochemically silent.
• Paragangliomas (extra-adrenal pheos): a tumor
derived from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells of
the sympathetic paravertebral ganglia of thorax,
abdomen, and pelvis. Paragangliomas also arise
from parasympathetic ganglia located along the
glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the neck
and at the base of the skull; these do not usually
produce catecholamines.
• About 80 to 85% of chromaffin-cell tumors are
pheochromocytomas, whereas 15 to 20% are
paragangliomas.

Pheochromocytoma Prevalence
• The prevalence of PPGL in patients with HTN in general outpatient
clinics varies between 0.2 and 0.6%.
• Autopsy studies demonstrate undiagnosed tumors in 0.05–0.1% of
patients.
• Nearly 5% of pts with incidentally discovered adrenal masses on
anatomical imaging prove to have a pheochromocytoma.
• Most are sporadic and benign (rarely can have malignant pheos).

Pheochromocytoma: Clinical Features
• Its clinical presentation may be variable.
• Classic triad:
• Episodes of palpitation
• Headache
• Profuse sweating
• The dominant sign is hypertension.
• Classically, patients have episodic hypertension, but sustained hypertension is also common.
• Catecholamine crises can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias,
intracranial hemorrhage, and death
• During episodes of hormone release, which can occur at widely divergent intervals,
patients are anxious and pale, and they experience tachycardia and palpitations.
• These paroxysms generally last <1 h and may be precipitated by surgery, positional
changes, exercise, pregnancy, urination (particularly with bladder pheochromocytomas),
and various medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, metoclopramide.)
Harrison’s 19e
Pheochromocytomas Diagnosis
• Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas synthesize and store
catecholamines, which include NE, Epi and dopamine.
• Elevated plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines
form the cornerstone of diagnosis.
• The characteristic fluctuations in the hormonal activity of tumors results in
considerable variation in serial catecholamine measurements.
• However, most tumors continuously leak O-methylated metabolites, which
are detected by measurement of metanephrines.
• Plasma fractionated mets
• Very sensitive (95-98%)
• Not as specific (89- 95%)
J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003;88(2):553
Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2007;66(5):703
JCEM, 2014, 99: 1915-1942.
• If low probability for
pheochromocytoma can
consider measurement of 24-
hour urinary fractionated
metanephrines and
catecholamines
Pheochromocytomas Evaluation
• Cross sectional Imaging with CT
or MRI
• MIBG scan
• iodine-123
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)
scintigraphy may be done. MIBG is
a compound resembling
norepinephrine that is taken up by
adrenergic tissue.
• A MIBG scan can detect tumors
not detected by CT or MRI or
multiple tumors when CT or MRI is
positive
Pheochromocytomas Evaluation
• Fludeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET)
is more sensitive than 123-I
MIBG and CT/MRI for detection
of metastatic disease
Pheochromocytoma Treatment
• RESECTION! (By an experienced team.)
• Preoperative medical therapy:
• Control hypertension
• Alpha-adrenergic blockade for 10-14 days prior
• Phenoxybenzamine→ irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking
agent
• Selective alpha-1-adrenergic blocking agents
• Volume expansion
• On day 3 of alpha blockade patients are encouraged to start a diet high in sodium
content (>5000 mg daily) because of the catecholamine-induced volume contraction and
the orthostasis associated with alpha-adrenergic blockade
Overview
• DISORDERS OF ADRENAL HYPERFUNCTION
• Case
• Cushing’s Syndrome
• Catecholamine Secreting Tumors→ Pheochromocytomas
• Conn’s Syndrome (Primary hyperaldosteronism)
• Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC)
• Summary
Primary Hyperaldosteronism (PA)
• 34-year old woman with a 7-year history of muscle spasms,
temporary paralysis, tetany, and weakness and a 4-year history of
hypertension.
• She had a blood pressure of 176/104mm Hg,
• Severe hypokalemia (potassium, 1.6-2.5 mEq/L),
• Mild hypernatremia (sodium, 146-151 mEq/L), and
• Alkalosis (serum pH 7.62).
J Lab Clin Med. 1955; 45: 3-17.
J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1995;80:3438-3441.
Endocr Pract.. 2010 Sep-Oct;16(5):888-902.
PA
• Since there were no signs or symptoms of glucocorticoid or androgen excess, the doctor
suspected, on the basis of his past research, that this patient’s clinical presentation could
result from excess secretion of the adrenal salt-retaining corticoid.
• She was studied in the Metabolism Research Unit for 227 days.
• Her urine was measured and she averaged 1333 μg deoxycorticosterone equivalent per
day compared with normotensive controls at 61.4 μg per day.
• The physician stated: “It is believed that these studies delineate a new clinical syndrome
which is designated temporarily as primary aldosteronism.”
• Conn’s Syndrome.
J Lab Clin Med. 1955; 45: 3-17.
Conn’s Syndrome:
• Conn planned for a bilateral adrenalectomy on December 10, 1954.
• But they encountered a right 13-g adrenal tumor, which was removed
while leaving the contralateral gland intact.
• The patient’s post-op studies showed an almost total reversal of the
preoperative metabolic and clinical abnormalities.
• Conn had achieved irrefutable proof of the validity of his investigative
conclusions and established for the first time the relationship among
adrenal aldosterone-producing tumors, hypertension, and
hypokalemia
J Lab Clin Med. 1955; 45: 3-17.
Primary Hyperaldosteronism (PA)
• The most common cause of mineralocorticoid excess is Primary
Aldosteronism, reflecting excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal
zona glomerulosa.
• Excess activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor leads to K depletion
and increased Na retention→ an expansion of extracellular and plasma
volume.
• Subtypes of PA
• BL idiopathic hyperaldosteronism accounts for 65% of cases of PA
• Aldosterone-producing adenoma accounts for 30%
• Important to differentiate which subtype since treatment is different based on the
etiology
• Tx for adenoma→ Surgery
• Tx for BL hyperplasia→ Mineralocorticoid (Aldosterone) Receptor Antagonists
Nat Clin Pract Nephrol..2006;2:198-208.
J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004; 89:1045-1050.
PA Diagnosis:
• Evaluate patients who exhibit HTN
associated with drug resistance,
hypokalemia, an adrenal mass, or
onset of disease before the age of
40 years.
• The accepted screening test is
concurrent measurement of
plasma renin and aldosterone
with subsequent calculation of the
aldosterone
-renin ratio (ARR);
serum potassium needs to be
normalized prior to testing.
Overview
• DISORDERS OF ADRENAL HYPERFUNCTION
• Case
• Cushing’s Syndrome
• Catecholamine Secreting Tumors→ Pheochromocytomas
• Conn’s Syndrome (Primary hyperaldosteronism)
• Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC)
• Summary
Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma:
(ACC)
• Two different primary malignancies that can arise from the adrenal gland:
• Malignant pheochromocytomas
• Adrenocortical carcinomas
• Both are extremely rare
• Large masses (>4cm) always suspect ACC.
• ACCs have an estimated incidence of ~0.5-2 new cases per 1,000,000
people per year
• Follows a bimodal age distribution with peaks in childhood and in fourth to fifth decades of
life
• More frequent in women than in men (1.5:1)
• Can be secretory, patients should be evaluated for hormonal excess, including for excess
glucocorticoids, catecholamines and sex steroids
Nat Rev Endocrinol 2011; 7: 323-335.
Annals of Oncology 23(Supplement 7): vii131-vii138, 2012.
Androgen Secreting
Adrenocortical Carcinomas (ACC)
• 60% ACCs present with hormone excess:
• Cushing’s syndrome (45%)
• Mixed Cushing’s/Androgen excess (25%)
• Androgens alone (10%)
• Rare cause of androgen excess
• Presents with rapid onset virilization – hirsutism, acne,
clitoromegaly, voice change
• Secreted androgens: DHEA & DHEA-S, > 700 mcg/dL
ACC
Adrenocortical carcinomas
• Two rare inherited causes of ACC are LiFraumeni syndrome and BeckwithWiedemann syndrome.
• In most cases, adrenocortical carcinomas are
large, invasive lesions that efface the native
adrenal gland.
• Adrenal cancers have a strong tendency to
invade the adrenal vein, vena cava, and
lymphatics.
• The median patient survival is about 2 years.
Of note, carcinomas metastatic to the adrenal
cortex are significantly more frequent than a
primary ACC.
• Treatment of ACC is surgical resection,
mitotane (which directly suppresses the
adrenal cortex) and possible chemotherapy.
Overview
• DISORDERS OF ADRENAL HYPERFUNCTION
• Case
• Cushing’s Syndrome
• Catecholamine Secreting Tumors→ Pheochromocytomas
• Conn’s Syndrome (Primary hyperaldosteronism)
• Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC)
• Summary
Back to our patient:
• 46 year old man with 2cm adrenal incidentaloma, stable vital signs
(no HTN.)
• Screened for Cushing’s Syndrome, pheochromocytoma.
• 1mg dexamethasone suppression test → AM cortisol the next morning is
1.0mcg/dL (demonstrates appropriate suppression)
• Plasma metanephrines are in the normal range
• Does not need screening for primary hyperaldosteronism because he
does not have HTN.
• Given that his lesion is <4cm low suspicion for ACC.
• This patient, like most patient’s with an adrenal incidentaloma, has a
nonfunctional tumor.
Summary
• Cushing’s Syndrome:
• Glucocorticoid excess:
• Suspect based on signs and symptoms (or if adrenal nodule)
• Document Hypercortisolemia (1mg dex suppression test or 24 hour urine free cortisol)
• Determine Cause (ACTH dependent vs independent)
• Treat (almost always surgical)
• Pheochromocytoma:
• Catecholamine producing tumors
• Conn’s Syndrome:
• Increased aldosterone, suppressed renin
• ACC:
• Aggressive cancer with high mortality
• May be secretory

STATEMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AND HUMILITY:
Objectives
• Understand the critical importance of monitoring linear growth
during childhood
• Understand that linear growth is a window into the overall health of
an infant or child
• Understand that growth can be impacted by many factors including
genetics, nutritional adequacy, illness
• Understand the approach to the child with abnormal growth
• Understand some of the causes of abnormal growth
Overview
• Growth is one of the most fundamental aspects of pediatric care
• Abnormalities in growth are often an early sign in underlying disease
• Understanding normal growth, normal growth variants, and abnormal
growth are critical in the care of children
• Standardized growth charts are used to plot stature for age
• Growth is monitored multiple times in first year of life, then spreads
out to once per year as child gets older
• Critical that children see a doctor at prescribed time points to
properly catch any deviations from normal
Growth Charts
• Developed by the CDC
• Revised in 2000
• Prior charts were based on middle class Caucasian children in Iowa
and Boston
• New charts represent all major racial-ethnic groups
• Regardless of racial-ethnic status children in the US have similar
growth patterns and the use of a standardized growth chart is
possible
Avg height in US
for a female is 64”
Avg height in US
for a male is 69”

Proper Measurement Techniques
Infantometer
Stadiometer
Normal Growth Velocity by Age
*Growth occurs in spurts – not consistent throughout a calendar year.
*Maximal growth hormone production is during sleep.
*50% of adult bone mass is accrued during pubertal growth spurt.
The growth spurt in males comes at the end of puberty - boys grow for 2 more
years than girls: men are 13cm (5 inches) taller than women on average
Target Height
• Genetics plays the dominant role in growth and height potential
• Height is at least 80% genetic and is a polygenic trait
• Midparental target height can be calculated – very helpful in
understanding growth patterns
Tall parents tend to have tall children, short parents tend to have short children. A
projected adult height that differs from the midparental height by more than 10cm
suggests a pathologic condition
MIDPARENTAL TARGET HEIGHT
Father height 177.8 cm
PLUS (minus for a girl)
13 cm
PLUS
Mother height 160.0 cm
Divide by 2
Target Height = 175.4 cm (5’9)
When parents’ heights are very
discrepant mean parental height
is not as useful – child may trend
towards one parent
Predicted Adult Height
• Bone age x-rays – key component of a growth evaluation
• Skeletal maturation can be determined using an x-ray of the left hand
and wrist
• Assess the bone maturation of multiple ossification centers and
compare to standards (Greulich and Pyle Standards)
• The bone age is then compared to the chronological age and allows
for calculation of final height prediction (target height vs predicted
height)
• Pitfall: these standards are based on normally growing white children
from 1931-1942

Major Players Involved in Growth
• Genetic Potential
• Nutritional Status – growth is impacted by availability of nutrients
• Endocrine factors – growth hormone/IGF-1, thyroid hormone, sex
steroids
• Chronic disease
• Psychosocial stress
Short Stature Definition
• A height more than 2 SDs below the mean for age
• Less than the 3rd percentile on the height growth curve
• Dwarfism is short stature resulting from a genetic or medical
condition – defined as an adult height of 147 cm or less (4 feet 10
inches)
Las Meninans, Velazquez
Tall Stature Definition
• A height more than 2 SDs above the mean for age
• Greater than the 97th percentile on the growth curve
• Gigantism is tall stature in children resulting from excessive
production of growth hormone

The predominant pathway for
endocrine regulation of somatic
growth is the Growth Hormone
(GH)/Insulin Like Growth
Factor 1 (IGF-1) axis. GH
synthesis and secretion occurs
in the anterior pituitary.
The “Master Gland”
Through secretion of its
hormones, the pituitary
gland controls metabolism,
growth, sexual maturation,
reproduction, blood
pressure, stress hormone
release, lactation and other
vital processes.
GH/IGF-1 Axis
• GH is produced in the somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary
• Single chain 191-amino acid, 22-kDa protein
• GH synthesis and release is controlled via a feedback loop
• Stimulated by GHRH (growth hormone releasing hormone) produced
in the hypothalamus
• Inhibited by SRIF (somatotropin release inhibitory factor) produced in
the hypothalamus
• During stage IV sleep SRIF is low and GHRH is high, resulting in
nocturnal pulses of GH (most GH is released at night)
Fine RN, 1995
Regulation of GH Secretion
• Complex
• Affected by neurotransmitters that vary widely depending on
sleep/stress/fasting and other states
• Androgens/estrogens/thyroxine/glucocorticoids also impact release
• Blunted GH secretion: low thyroid levels and glucocorticoid excess
• Stimulated GH secretion: sex steroids during puberty (pubertal
growth spurt)
• Ghrelin: “hunger hormone” seems to stimulate GH secretion
Growth Hormone Action
• In serum GH is free or bound to GH binding protein (GHBP)
• About 45% is bound
• GH travels to the target cell where it binds to the GHR (a cytokine
tyrosine kinase receptor)
• Once in the cell gene transcription is initiated to make IGF-1 through
the JAK-STAT signaling pathway
• IGF-1 mediates the many of the actions of GH by stimulating growth
of bones and other tissues, and promotes lean muscle mass
• Most measurable IGF-1 is produced in the liver, but also produced
locally in the bone where there are GHRs
IGF-1
• Insulin like growth factor
• Hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin
• Encoded by the IGF1 gene
• It is predominantly bound to IGFBP3 (one of 6 IGF binding proteins)
• Highest rate of production is during puberty
• Undernutrition - low levels of IGF-1
• Longevity has been tied to low levels of IGF-1 (idea behind low calorie
diets and intermittent fasting)
researchgate.net
IGF-1 receptor present in
many cell types andIGF-1
regulates many critical
biological process including
growth/development/aging
After receptor activation
IGF-1 triggers processes
that lead to cell growth and
prevention of apoptosis
Jung, Front. Genet. 2015
Can blocking IGF-1
action help delay the
aging process?
Ongoing studies
looking at
medications like
metformin which
may block some of
these pathways
GH Resistance – Laron Dwarfism
• Mutation in the GHR gene which
encodes the GH receptor
• Slightly reduced birth length
• Very low IGF-1 production – can
this protect from age related
diseases?
Growth Hormone Functions
• Stimulates bone remodeling and accrual of bone mass/promotes
growth at the epiphyses
• Stimulates lipolysis and fat utilization for energy
expenditure/decreases lipogenesis
• Growth and preservation of lean tissue mass by increasing amino
acid transport and nitrogen retention
• Necessary for normal lipid metabolism
• Necessary for normal body composition maturation
• GH declines with age to prepubertal levels in early adulthood, and
gradually declines further with aging
Fetal Growth
• Key regulators are insulin/IGF-1/IGF-2 which are produced by the fetus
• NOT regulated by growth hormone (infants born with GH deficiency have
low-normal length at birth)
• Insulin production by the fetus is an important regulator of fetal growth,
production is tied to glucose availability (important for mother to have
proper nutrition and blood sugar control during gestation)
• Normal fetal production of IGF-1 is also regulated by nutrition
• Role of IGF-2 is more complex, has been postulated that overexpression
may be a risk factor for future obesity
Leprechaunism
• Extremely rare disorder of
insulin resistance – severe
intrauterine growth retardation
• Mutation of the insulin receptor
gene (INSR gene)
Postnatal Growth
• First few months of infancy nutritional adequacy is essential with its
ongoing effect on insulin and IGF-1 production
• Congenital Hypothyroidism –not a major player in the fetus – but low
thyroid hormone levels will cause profound growth failure and severe
impairment of brain development (thyroid levels are checked on the
newborn screen)
• “Cretinism”
Dwarfism: Disproportionate Short Stature
Achondroplasia
• Causes short stature but not related to growth hormone
• Disorder of bone growth caused by mutations in the FGFR3 (fibroblast
growth factor receptor 3) gene
• FGFR3 is overactive and cartilage does not fully develop into bone –
bones are shortened, particularly effects long bones
• Autosomal dominant
• Most cases are de novo mutations
• Often diagnosed in utero
• Apparent at birth
Growth Part 2

Dwarfism: Proportionate Short Stature
• Growth hormone deficiency
• Myriad of causes
• Congenital – genetic mutation or structural defect – often not
recognized until a few months of age or later
• Acquired – trauma/infection/tumor within the brain affecting the
pituitary
• Idiopathic
Classic GH deficiency features
• Young looking round face “cherubic”
• Higher level of body fat especially around waist
• Low muscle mass
• Fatigue
• Appear much younger than chronological age
• Delayed puberty
• Delayed tooth eruption
Congenital/Non-acquired GH deficiency
• Birth weight and length near normal
• Prolonged jaundice at birth and/or hypoglycemia are common
• Microphallus
• Growth failure usually evident by 6-12 months
• May or may not occur with other pituitary deficiencies (thyroid,
cortisol, gonadotropins)
• May be due to genetic mutations or anatomical defects in the
pituitary
• These defects can be partial so the growth failure is not evident until
the child is older
Weight spared more
than height – typical of
growth hormone
deficiency
THIS IS NEVER NORMAL
Growth Hormone Deficiency
Multiple pituitary specific transcription factors are involved in pituitary
cell lineages and hormone expression – defects along this cascade can
lead to GH deficiency

Acquired growth failure
• Undernutrition secondary to poverty is the most common cause of
growth failure worldwide
• If you don’t eat you won’t grow
• Weight affect first and more profoundly than length, but final height
is stunted by inadequate nutrition
• Undernutrition during puberty due to caloric restriction (extreme
athletes, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, fad diets) will compromise final
height if a child is still growing – even if nutrition improves
Failure to Thrive
Anorexia Nervosa
Weight is affect first and more profoundly than height
Acquired growth failure
• Endocrine causes: Cushing’s syndrome, thyroid disorders
• Intracranial processes: brain tumors such as craniopharyngioma, hypothalamic tumors
-compress pituitary gland or hypothalamus
-compresses optic nerve (visual disturbances)
• Chronic disease: anemia, celiac, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic renal disease,
hypermetabolic states such as cardiac disease
• Medications:
-chronic steroids can blunt GH release, inhibit IGF-1 activity, and have a direct
negative effect on bone development
- amphetamines (ie Adderall for attention deficit) controversial effect,
possibly secondary to decreased appetite and caloric intake
• Psychosocial Dwarfism: rare disorder caused by extreme emotional deprivation, stress, and
neglect in the setting of adequate nutrition; growth improves when removed from home
Exogenous Obesity
• Obesity is quite frequent in the pediatric population
• Rapid linear growth and advanced bone age is characteristic of obese
children
• Tall stature throughout childhood and earlier pubertal growth spurt
• Final height is within expected genetic range
• Combination of obesity and short stature for age more likely to be
pathological
THIS IS NEVER NORMAL
Exogenous obesity
–
generally end up at target
height if overweight is
due to over nutrition
Cushing’s Syndrome
–
very rare endocrine
disorder due to excess
cortisol production by the
adrenal gland. Stunts
height progression and
causes obesity
Cushing’s Syndrome: hypercortisolism
• Weight gain and growth failure
• Purple striae
• Round “moon” facies
• Dorsocervical fat pad “buffalo
hump”
• Acne
• Virilization
• Lethargy/labile
• Easy bruising
Acquired Hypothyroidism
Constitutional growth delay -
“late bloomers” – “gray” cases,
often get a full work up, end up
at target height
Precocious puberty – growth
spurt earlier, often end up not
hitting target height
Familial short stature – parents
are short, end up at target
height
Common Growth Variants
What would the bone age be for each
of these children at a chronological age
of age 10 years?
Constitutional delay – 8 years (predicted
height = target height)
Precocious puberty – 12 to 13 years
(predicted height < target height)
Familial short stature – 10 years
(predicted height = target height)
Constitutional Delay of Growth
• Variation in the tempo of growth, not a disorder of growth
• Delayed puberty and bone age
• Labs are normal and match bone age
• Growth velocity is normal but at a lower percentile
• Final height is normal and meets mid parental target height
• Normally one or both parents were a “late bloomer”
• One of the most common reasons boys see an endocrinologist
Approach to the child with concerning growth
• Growth velocity has slowed (not in relation to weight loss)
• Child’s height pattern falls significantly outside of expected parental
range (measure the parents if possible)
• Short child with physical stigmata or other signs of an underlying
genetic disorder
• Detailed past medical history, family history, review of systems,
physical exam, examination of the growth curve
• Begin the work-up: acuteness of the change, the physical exam, and
other symptoms will help guide the work-up
Evaluation
• Laboratory studies to evaluate overall health
• Complete blood count, markers of inflammation (sedimentation rate
and C-reactive protein), metabolic panel, thyroid studies, celiac
screen
• Excessive weight gain and slowed height velocity – evaluate for
Cushing syndrome
• Headache and/or visual symptoms MRI of the brain to rule out
intracranial pathology
• Physical stigmata – genetic testing
Testing for GH deficiency – an imperfect test
• Complicated, uncomfortable and time consuming
• Secretion is pulsatile and peaks overnight during sleep
• Random samples are meaningless
• Fasting samples over 2 hours after provocative tests with medications
“GH stim test”
• Cutoffs are arbitrary, test is often not reproducible
• Peak GH levels over 10 ng/ml after stimulation are considered
normal, 5-10 ng/ml probably deficient, under 5 ng/ml is deficient
• Testing is important for insurance coverage
FDA approved uses for GH (not complete)
• Growth hormone deficiency
• Idiopathic short stature
• Chronic renal disease
• Turner syndrome
• Prader Willi Syndrome
• Small for gestational age
• Cachexia due to AIDS
• Adult growth hormone deficiency
Prader-Willi Syndrome
• Mutation on chromosome 15
• Obese, hypotonia, short stature,
small hands and feet, behavioral
abnormalities
• Features reflect hypothalamic
dysfunction: hyperphagia, sleep
disorders, low GH secretion and
hypogonadism
• Treatment with GH helps with
height but also body composition
and improves lean muscle mass
Turner Syndrome
• 45, X karyotype
• Classic clinical appearance:
congenital lymphedema, low
hairline, webbed neck, broad chest,
short fourth metacarpals,
dysplastic nails
• Recurrent otitis media, thyroid
disease, cardiac, renal and urologic
abnormalities, ovarian failure
• Almost 100% have short stature
warranting use of GH (avg height
untreated about 4 feet 9 inches)
Small for Gestational Age (SGA)
• Birth weight and or length < 3%
• About 90% will catch up by age 2 years
• For those who do not (growth remains < 2SDS) GH is FDA approved, GH testing is
normal, high doses are required
• Increasing evidence that disordered fetal growth (too small OR too big) has
powerful implications for later health: fetal origins of adult disease
• Intrauterine growth restriction during critical period of sensitivity to the nutrient
environment leads to permanent alterations in the function of hormonal and
regulatory pathways
• SGA children have a higher risk as adults for obesity, T2D, hypertension, especially
if they have excessive weight gain postnatally
• Fetal overnutrition is also a risk for later disease such as obesity and T2D
Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS)
• Diagnosis of exclusion – applied to healthy short children with no identified
cause of “shortness”
• Height < 5% with a growth velocity that is normal, GH testing is normal
• BA=Chronological age
• Height of both parents tends to be 10% or less (familial short stature) –
very likely some cases of familial short stature are heritable subtle
disruptions in the growth axis
• Treatment with GH is very gray – are we treating a normal variant
• FDA approved for PH < 63” for a man and 59” for a woman
• Higher doses of GH required than for true GH deficiency
• Many families pay of out of pocket for treatment
Growth Hormone Therapy
• First isolated from the pituitary in 1950s
• Between 1963-1985 almost 8000 children with severe GH deficiency
were treated with GH from the pituitary of cadavers
• In the 1980s it was discovered that some of those children had
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
• Recombinant human GH was in the works (Genentech) and was ready
for use after 1985
• Now there was an unlimited safe supply – list of indications became
much broader
• Given via subcutaneous injection 6-7 days per week, weight based
Adverse reactions to treatment – overall good
safety profile
Short term
• Slipped capital femoral epiphyses
• Scoliosis
• Benign intracranial hypertension
(pseudotumor cerebri)
• Increased insulin resistance
Long term
• Question of increased risk of new
malignancy or malignancy
recurrence – very unlikely
• Question of increased risk of
premature cardiovascular disease –
newer study needs more data
• Disproportionate features such
large hands and feet, coarse facial
features, when used in non-GH
deficient cases
The “gray zone” of treatment - primum non nocere
• “Cosmetic endocrinology”
• The belief that height = happiness and or success
• Parents give GH to completely normal children to push height
• Boys referred 2x as often for evaluation
• Likely max achievable is an additional 1.5-2 inches
• Thousands of dollars (35K-50K PER INCH)
• Is this ethical?
• What are we “fixing”?
Tall Stature
• Much less common “complaint” than short stature
• More common for females to be referred for evaluation than males
• Constitutional tall stature is a variant of normal, generally normal
length at birth with growth acceleration 12-15 months of age
• Growth parallel to but above 95%, with normal growth velocity
• Usually tall parents/relatives
• Estrogen mediates epiphyseal fusion – can be used as therapy to
hasten cessation of growth
Excessive Growth Disorders
• Chromosomal disorders: 47 XXY
• Genetic Syndromes: Marfan
• Gigantism: excessive GH from a pituitary tumor
• Precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism, obesity: can accelerate growth
velocity
Klinefelter Syndrome (KS)
• 47,XXY
• Highly underdiagnosed, occurs
in 1:500-1:1000 live births
• May have learning difficulties
• Infertility
• Can treat with testosterone
• Cryopreservation of sperm
during puberty
• Mean final height is 73 inches
Marfan Syndrome • Autosomal dominant disorder,
but can be a spontaneous
mutation
• Mutation in the fibrillin gene
(FBN1) and possibly
dysregulation of TGF
-
B
• Affects connective tissue • 1:5000 • Debate of whether President
Lincoln had Marfan
Tall stature
Excessive arm and leg length
Ectopic lens (ectopia lentis
)
Kyphoscoliosis
Hyperextensible joints
Aortic root dilatation
Gigantism
• Excessive GH production from a
pituitary adenoma
• Different from acromegaly as the
growth plates are still open so tall
stature results
• Growth is accelerated and adult
predicted height is well above MPH
• Rare
• Usually requires resection of the
adenoma
Conclusions – evaluating growth is an art
• Yes there are some clear cut cases of GH deficiency or clearly defined
diagnoses that make treatment with GH obvious (these are rare)
• BUT…MANY cases are ambiguous and treatment is not clearly defined
• What is the relationship between the linear growth rate and weight?
• What other factors are impacting the growth: illness, familial height,
other genetic or endocrine disorders
• What do the bone age x-ray and laboratory results tell us
• Is treatment with GH indicated and what can we expect to achieve

Current Human Model of Male Sex Development
 Chromosomal sex determines gonadal sex & gonadal sex
determines phenotypic appearance (Alfred Jost)
 3 steps of sex development:
1. Fertilization: Chromosomal sex determination occurs: XY, XX
etc. For 6 wks fetus develop in non-binary fashion
2. 6 wks GA: Indifferent gonad differentiates into an ovary or
testis and the testis begins to secrete hormone
3. 12 wks: Urogenital tract develops into a male or female
structure
Gonadal and Phenotypic Differentiation of the
Urogenital Tract
• Presence of Y chromosome
and expression of SRY gene
lead undifferentiated gonad to
become a testis
• Fetal testosterone secretion
leads to the development of
wolffian ducts and a typical
male genital phenotype
• Secretion of antimüllerian
hormone by the Sertoli cells
of the fetal testis induces the
regression of the müllerian
ducts
• Without Y chromosome (and
SRY expression) and in the
presence of XX, female
gonadal and phenotypic
differentiation occurs, leading
to female genitalia
Copyrights apply
Factors Involved in Male Development:
Testicular Determination
Transition from gonadal sex to male phenotype
is hormonally regulated
 3 Key Hormones arising from
the fetal testes influence
phenotype
• AMH: Arises from Sertoli cells
and causes Mullerian duct
regression
• Testosterone: Causes
Wolffian duct differentiation
into epididymis, vas
deferens, seminal vesicles,
and ejaculatory ducts
 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT):
Regulates development of
prostate and male external
genitalia
5a reductase aromatase
Role of DHT in Male Sex Differentiation/Genitalia
 Role of DHT proven by observation that 5a reductase deficiency in
humans inhibits development of male external genitalia
 Prostate and male external genitalia are fully formed by 12 weeks
gestation
Androgen receptor is key to androgen action
 Both testosterone and
DHT exert their effects
via the Androgen
receptor to activate
target genes
 DHT binds more
effectively than
testosterone and is the
more potent androgen
Testosterone levels during male sexual
development
• Prenatal development
influenced by the
development of
androgen producing
testicular tissue
• Postnatal development
puberty/reproduction are
influenced by both
testosterone and by
estrogen.
Timing of Puberty
➢ Mean Age 10 years
➢ Varies among racial groups
➢ Influenced by genetics, adiposity/leptin, health
status
➢ Precocious puberty in a male is defined as
testicular enlargement beginning before the age
of 9 yrs
GnRH Pulse Generator & Physiology of Puberty
Physiology of Puberty
 Pulsatile GnRH secretion
drives puberty
 Kisspeptin is thought to
have important roles in
puberty
 Kisspeptin secreted by
hypothalamic neurons
and stimulates GnRH
secretion

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES OF POLYCYSTIC
OVARIAN SYNDROME
• á LH:FSH ratio
• á Estrogen
• á Androgens
• â Sex hormone binding globulin
• Insulin resistance
PCOS Pathophysiology
UpToDate
1) Functional ovarian
hyperandrogenism - essential
clinical feature
a) Leads to high androgen and
high estrogen state
2) Insulin resistance and
hyperinsulinism present in ½ PCOS
cases:
a) Excess insulin action in ovary, liver,
adipocytes
b) In the ovary – insulin synergizes with
LH to upregulate androgen
production
c) Causes premature luteinization of
granulosa cells and hinders ovulation
3) LH excess results bc excess
androgen interferes with progesterone
negative feedback on LH. LH secretion
sustains ovarian androgen production
but is not thought to cause it

Figure 1-5 Summary of the ovarian cycle, fertilization, and human development during the first week. Stage 1 of development begins with fertilization in the
uterine tube and ends when the zygote forms. Stage 2 (days 2-3) comprises the early stages of cleavage (from 2 to about 32 cells, the morula). Stage 3 (days
4-5) consists of the free (unattached) blastocyst. Stage 4 (days 5-6) is represented by the blastocyst attaching to the posterior wall of the uterus, the usual site
of implantation. The blastocysts have been sectioned to show their internal structure. (From Moore KL, Persaud TVN: The Developing Human: Clinically

Ovarian endometriomas
IV
Endometriosis
Medical treatment of endometriosis does not
increase fertility rates
Surgical treatment?
modest increase in fertility
should be treated if incidentally encountered b/c
endometriosis is a progressive disease
value of diagnostic laparoscopy for unexplained
infertility is questionable
Cervical factor
“Hostile mucus”- thick mucus may be
physical barrier to sperm penetration
Peak E2 prior to ovulation stimulates cervical
glands to produce clear, watery mucus
Spinnbarkeit (stretchability) @ midcycle
should be >5 cm with ferning
P4 counteracts E2 to make mucus thick &
opaque
V
Good cervical mucus
Endometrial Factor
Müllerian anomalies
Submucosal fibroids
Endometrial polyps
(more likely cause pregnancy loss than
infertility)
Luteal phase defect- lag in 2 or more days in histological development of endometrium
compared to day of cycle (lack of synchrony
between ovary and endometrium)
VI
Male Factor
2 major components of testes
Leydig Cells: testosterone producing
Seminiferous tubules: sperm production
74 days required to produce spermatozoa
50 days in tubule, 12-20 days to travel epididymis to
appear in ejaculate

Keratinocyte debris
Sebaceous gland
Pilosebaceous Unit
Retained keratin and comedo formation
Pathogenesis of Acne
Sebum production
Hormone stimulation of sebaceous glands
Inflammation and rupture of the follicle:
Acne Pathogenesis
P. acnes within follicle lipolytic, liberates free fatty acids
Promotes inflammation
Pathogenesis of Acne Vulgaris
• Androgens increase sebum production
– Stimulation of sebaceous glands at puberty
– Excess androgen in some patients
• Altered keratinization in follicle - “plug”
• Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) proliferates
– Pro-inflammatory
• Inflammation
– Innate immune system
4 Key Factors in
Acne Pathogenesis:
• Androgens > Sebum production
• “Sticky” keratinocytes
• P. acnes
• Inflammation
Acne Vulgaris
• “Non-inflammatory” lesions = “early”
– Open comedones
– Closed comedones
• Inflammatory lesions = “later”
– Papules
– Pustules
– Nodules
– Cysts
• Scars = “latest”
– Hyperpigmented
– Atrophic or hypertrophic scars
Open Comedones
• Blackheads
• Dilated follicular
orifice with
keratinocyte debris
Closed Comedones
• Whiteheads
• Plugged follicle with
small follicular orifice
• May develop into an
inflammatory lesion
Papules and Pustules
• Inflammatory lesions
Erythematous papules
and pustules
Nodules and Cysts
• Inflammatory lesions
• Deep erythematous
lesions
• Scarring
With proper treatment, scarring can be minimized.
Post-Inflammatory
Hyperpigmentation
• Inflammatory lesions
• Deep erythematous
lesions
• Scarring
• Post inflammatory
Hyperpigmentation
With proper treatment, scarring can be minimized.

Acne Evaluation
• History:
– Age of onset
– Topical products
– Medications
– Menstrual irregularities
• Physical examination:
– Hirsuitism
– Striae
– Secondary sex characteristics/virilization/precocious puberty
• For severe, difficult to control, or acne associated with
other signs/symptoms of androgen excess:
– Laboratory testing
– Endocrine referral
Factors that contribute to acne
• Local occlusive effects of topical products
• Acne may be a sign of underlying endocrinologic dysfunction
– Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
– Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-classic CAH)
– Androgen-secreting tumors: Adrenal, pituitary
• Medications
➢ Non-comedogenic topical products
are recommended
Factors that contribute to acne
• Medications can cause acne eruptions
– Testosterone
– Gonadotrophin
– Anabolic steroids
– Corticosteroids
– Lithium
– Cyclosporin
– Sirolimus
– Isoniazid
– Rifampicin
• Acneiform:
– Erlotinib (Epidermal Growth Factor-rcpt Ab)
– Cetuximab (Epidermal Growth Factor-rcpt Ab)
Acne Therapy
Main factors in acne
pathogenesis:
Androgens > PSU/Sebum production
“Sticky” keratinocytes > comedones
P. acnes proliferation
Inflammation
If possible we try to treat each of these factors.
Combination therapy works better than monotherapy.
Acne Therapy
P. Acnes: Antibacterial Agents
OTC Topical Therapy:
• Benzoyl peroxide gel, cream = Bacteriocidal
Acne Therapy:
Comedolytic Agents
• Comedolytic agents decrease “sticky”
keratinocytes
• OTC Topical therapy:
• Salicylic acid
• Glycolic acid
“Sticky” Keratinocytes:
Comedolytic Agents
Rxn Topical Retinoids:
• Tretinoin cream, gel (Retin A®
, others)
– Normalizes the maturation of the follicular epithelium
– Prevents comedo formation
• Adapalene cream, gel
– Not a true retinoid but binds to retinoid receptor
– Similar effects as tretinoin
– (Adapalene gel now available OTC)
• Tazarotene 0.1% cream or gel
– Potent retinoid
– Pregnancy category X
Topical retinoid precautions
• Warn patients:
– Irritation – use a small amount, emolliate
– Sun precautions
– Don’t mix with benzoyl peroxide (inactivates)
• Note: stabilized combination products have been
developed
– Do not wax eyebrows or facial hair
– Several weeks of treatment required for effect
P. Acnes:
Antimicrobial Agents
Rxn Topical Therapy:
• Benzoyl peroxide gel, cream
• Azelaic acid gel, lotion, cream
• Erythromycin gel, solution, cream
• Clindamycin gel, solution, lotion
• Combination products*
– *Less P. acnes resistance
• Benzoyl peroxide-erythromycin gel
• Benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin gel
= Bacteriocidal
Question 1:
A 17 year old girl with mild inflammatory acne presents for
evaluation. She has been using a benzoyl peroxide
preparation in the morning and adapalene gel in the
evening for 3 weeks without much improvement.
The next appropriate step in her therapy is to:
A. Continue therapy without changes
B. Switch from adapalene to tazarotene gel
C. Add tetracycline po
D. Add doxycycline po
E. Add an oral contraceptive

Acne therapy often takes at least 6 weeks of
continuous use before seeing a maximum
benefit
Moderate to Severe Acne:
Systemic Antibiotics
– Tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline
– Erythromycin
– Goal is 3 months of therapy: Antibiotic Stewardship
– Adverse effects:
• Photosensitivity (tetracycline and doxycycline)
• GI effects – pill esophagitis, gut microbiome
• Yeast/candidal infections
• Hepatoxicity
• Pseudotumor cerebri
• Increased with minocycline:
– Lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis
– Minocycline pigmentation
– DRESS syndrome
» Maubec et al, Dermatology. 2008;216:200–4.
Hormonal Acne Therapy
• Oral contraceptives:
– FDA approved to treat moderate acne in menstruating females
age 14 years and up:
• Ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate (Ortho Tri-Cyclen)
• Ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone (Yaz)
– Note: progestin-only contraceptive depots can stimulate acne
– Cautions include: risk of thromboembolism
• Low dose estrogen combined with progesterone may minimize risk
• Spironolactone
– Aldosterone antagonist
– Competitive inhibitor of androgen receptor
• Anti-androgen effects
– Cautions include: hyperkalemia

and only minimal improvement.
The next appropriate step is to:
C. Refer to dermatology for possible isotretinoin
therapy
This patient is at risk for permanent irreversible
scarring
Sebum production:
Isotretinoin
• Vitamin A derivative inhibits all 4 factors in
acne pathogenesis
– Inhibits sebaceous glands
– Normalizes keratinization
– Decreases P. acnes population
– Anti-inflammatory
• All prescribers and patients must enroll in
ipledge program (www.ipledgeprogram.com)
Isotretinoin: Response

Hirsutism & Acne
Dr. Page-Wilson,
Division of Endocrinology
Conflicts of Interest
• None
Case
• A 25 year old woman with no significant past
medical history presents to an endocrinologist’s
office complaining of increased hair growth on
her chin and breasts.
• She has also noted “more pimples”, some of
them with “white pus”.
• She states that she has always had more hair and
pimples than her friends but over the past few
months it seems to be getting worse and she
would like to know if there is something wrong
with her.
Hirsutism: Objectives
1) To understand pathophysiology of androgen
mediated hair growth
2) To understand the potential causes of
hirsutism
3) To learn about the medical management of
hirsutism
Hirsutism
• 5% of reproductive age women
are hirsute
• Definition: Hirsutism is defined as
excessive terminal hair that
appears in a male pattern in
women
• Ferriman-Gallwey Scale: Modified
scale used to grade hair growth;
score > 8/36 abnormal is US
population and defines hirsutism
• Racial and ethnic differences in
what is considered normal
• Most important consideration is
whether rate or pattern of hair
growth has changed
Androgens and Hair Growth
• Hair categories:
A. Vellus: Fine, soft, non-pigmented
hairs
B. Terminal: Long, coarse, pigmented
• Number of hair follicles (5 mil) is fixed
• Androgens induce vellus follicles in
most androgen sensitive sites to
develop into terminal hairs
• Androgens increase hair growth:
upper lip, chin, side-burns,
midsternum, upper abd, back, inner
thighs, buttocks
• Androgens lead to hair loss in the
scalp region
Pathogenesis of Hirsutism
• Pre-puberty: Vellus hair, small
sebaceous glands
• Androgens differentiation of
pilosebaceous units (sebaceous
gland, hair shaft and follicle) into:
– a terminal hair
– OR a sebaceous gland with a
hair that remains vellus
• Androgens present:
– PSUs large terminal hair
follicles in sexual hair areas
– PSUs sebaceous glands in
non-sexual hair areas
(Rosenfield RL et al. Am J Med 1995;98:80S)
Pathogenesis of Hirsutism
• Stimulation of hair growth/hirsutism depends not only on
presence of androgens but also on the sensitivity of the hair
follicle to androgen
• Severity of hirsutism does not always correlate with level of
androgen
• In some women hirsutism develops without the presence of excess
androgen (idiopathic hirsutism)
• Some women with excess androgens do not develop hirsutism,
although most do
Major Androgens in Women
• DHEA-S
• DHEA
• Androstenedione
• Testosterone
• Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
Androgen Biosynthesis
SHBG
- androgens
- obesity
- cortisol excess
- hyperinsulinemia
SHBG
- estrogen
- cirrhosis
- anorexia
Sources of Circulating Androgens
in Women
Etiology of Hirsutism
• PCOS
• Idiopathic hirsutism/hyperandrogenism
• Non-classic CAH
• Ovarian tumors
• Ovarian hyperthecosis
• Adrenal tumors
• Cushing’s syndrome
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
• Most common cause of hirsutism in women
• Among hirsute pre-menopausal women: 50-80% have PCOS
• Diagnostic Criteria Include:
1) oligo or anovulation
2) biochemical ± clinical
hyperandrogenism
3) PCOM
*exclusion of other disorders
O’Driscoll JB et al. Clin Endocrinol 1994:231; Azziz R et al. JCEM 2004 89:453; Carmina E et al. JCEM 2006:91:2
Androgen excess in PCOS
• Androgen excess in PCOS
usually manifests itself
during puberty when
ovarian steroid
production increases
• Total testosterone should
be measured and free
testosterone labs can be
considered
• PCOS: Serum total
testosterone < 150 ng/dL
Idiopathic Hirsutism
• Diagnosis for women with
hirsutism but normal
androgens
• May results from
upregulation of androgen
receptor
• May result from
upregulated 5-α reductase
activity and increased DHT
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
• Autosomal recessive disorder involving deficiency of an
enzyme involved in cortisol or aldosterone synthesis
pathway
• 2 forms of CAH: “Classic” CAH which presents in infancy
and “Non-classic” CAH aka late onset CAH
“Classic” CAH
“Classic” CAH:
- 90% cases: 21-hydroxylase
deficiency
- Presents in infancy with:
1) adrenal insufficiency ±
2) salt wasting – FTT,
hyponatremia
3) virilization – ambiguous
genitalia in girls at birth, boys
present at 2-4 yrs with early
virilization
- Treatment involves
glucocorticoid ±
mineralocorticoid
replacement
“Non-classic” CAH
• 1/1,000 live births
• Autosomal recessive
• Non-classic CAH:
Caused by 21
hydroxylase (CYP21A2)
deficiency in 90% cases
• Enzyme deficiency
results in decreased
cortisol, increased
ACTH, and adrenal
androgen production
Clinical presentation of Non-classic CAH
Accounts for 2% cases of hirsutism in adult women:
• Hirsutism (59%)
• Menstrual irregularity (54%)
• Acne (33%)
• Infertility (13%) (Most conceive with
glucocorticoids)
• Clitoromegaly (10%)
Azziz LA et al. JCEM. 2004;89:453
Androgen Secreting Ovarian Tumors
• 0.2% women with hirsutism
• Histologically:
1) Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors
2) Granulosa-theca cell tumors
3) Hilus-cell tumors
• Testosterone concentrations
greater than 150 ng/dL (ULN 60
ng/dL)
• Occurs later in life, rapid onset
of virilization – hirsutism, voice
change, clitoromegaly
Ovarian Hyperthecosis
• Primarily seen in postmenopausal women
• Presents with progressive
hirsutism, acne, virilization
• Testosterone > 150 ng/ml
• Caused by increased
testosterone production by
luteinized theca cells in
stroma
• US shows increased
ovarian stromal volume *Arrows points to steroidogenically
active luteinized theca cells in the
ovarian stroma.
Androgen Secreting
Adrenocortical Carcinomas (ACC)
• 60% ACC’s present with hormone excess:
- Cushing’s syndrome (45%)
- Mixed Cushing’s/Androgen excess (25%)
- Androgens alone (10%)
• Rare cause of androgen excess
• Presents with rapid onset virilization – hirsutism, acne,
clitoromegaly, voice change
• Secreted androgens: DHEA & DHEA-S, > 700 mcg/dL
ACTH-dependent Cushing’s Syndrome
• Overproduction of ACTH
from a pituitary or ectopic
tumor results in cortisol
excess
• ACTH overproduction
stimulates adrenal
androgen production as
well as excess cortisol
• Cortisol decreases SHBG so
increases free testosterone
levels
• Facial hirsutism common
Pharmacologic Management of Hirsutism
• Estrogen-Progestin Oral Contraceptives
• Anti-androgens
• Glucocorticoids
Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs)
• OCPs: recommended initial therapy
• Transdermal estrogen/progestin equally effective
• Mechanism of Action:
1) Suppresses LH
2) Inhibits LH
dependent androgen
production
3) Increases SHBG
Recommended OCP Formulations
• 30 to 35mcg ethinyl
estradiol effective for
hirsutism
• Progestin with low or
no androgenicity
preferred
Anti-androgen Therapy
• Spironolactone:
- aldosterone antagonist
- competitive inhibitor of androgen receptor
- inhibits 5α-reductase
- FG reduction 15-40% in 6 mos
- risk of hyperkalemia
- risk of pseudohermaphroditism in male
offspring
• Drosperinone:
- Progestin in Yasmin, Yaz
- weak androgen receptor antagonist
• Cyproterone Acetate:
- used worldwide for rx hirsutism
- androgen receptor antagonist/inhibits 5αreductase
Anti-androgen Therapy
• Finasteride:
- Inhibits 5α-reductase type
2 activity
- Partially inhibits DHT
synthesis
- Hirsutism reduction
comparable to
spironolactone
Glucocorticoid Therapy for Treatment of
Hirsutism in Non-classic CAH
• Glucocorticoids suppress
ACTH, ACTH mediated
adrenal androgen
production
• Low doses may improve
hirsutism in non-classic
CAH
• Given side effects of
glucocorticoids, OCPs and
anti-androgens reasonable
first line therapy
Summary
• Hirsutism depends on presence of androgens and
on the sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgen
• PCOS is most common cause of hirsutism in
women
• PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion, less common
causes of hirsutism must be considered first
• OCPs and anti-androgens are commonly utilized
to treat hirsutism
Back to Case
• Patient had full endocrine evaluation
done, which was negative.
• She will proceed with laser
treatment for her excess hair.
• She will see dermatology for further
assessment and treatment of her
acne.

In FTM (transgender men) individuals, masculinizing hormone therapy was not
associated with significant changes in BMD, whereas in MTF (transgender women)
individuals feminizing hormone therapy was associated with an increase in BMD at
the lumbar spine. The impact of these BMD changes on patient-important
outcomes such as fracture risk is uncertain
Cross sex hormones in transgender individuals was associated with improvement in
gender dysphoria and depressive symptoms.
Medical Risks Associated with Sex Hormone Therapy
§ Transgender women; estrogen
§ Very high risk of adverse outcomes; thromboembolic disease
§ Moderate risk of adverse outcomes; macroprolactinoma, breast cancer, coronary

Endocrine Glands and Hormones:
Hormones
•Hormones are characterized in 1 of
3 classes:
•Peptides and proteins
•Synthesized from amino acids
•Steroids
•Derivatives of cholesterol
•Amines
•Derivatives of tyrosine
Endocrine Glands and Hormones:
Peptide
Hormones
Classification of Hormones
•Majority are Peptides:
Parathyroid Hormone
Proinsulin
1. In the nucleusà gene for
the hormone is transcribed
into an mRNA.
2. The mRNA is transferred to
the cytoplasm and
translated on the
ribosomes to the first
protein productà
preprohormone.
3. Translation then continues
on the endoplasmic
reticulum until the entire
peptide sequence is
produced.
Peptide and Protein Hormone
Synthesis
4. Signal peptide is removed in the
endoplasmic reticulum, converting
the preprohormone to a
prohormone. The prohormone
contains the complete hormone
sequence + other peptide sequences,
which will be removed at the final
step.
5. Prohormone transferred to the Golgi
apparatus, where it is packaged in
secretory vesicles. Proteolytic
enzymes cleave peptide sequences
from the prohormone to produce the
final hormone!
6. Final hormone is stored in secretory
vesicles until the endocrine cell is
stimulated.

Synthesis
Hormones
•Hormones are characterized in 1 of
3 classes:
•Peptides and proteins
•Synthesized from amino acids
•Steroids
•Derivatives of cholesterol
•Amines
•Derivatives of tyrosine
Steroid
Hormones
• Steroid hormones are
synthesized and secreted
by:
• adrenal cortex
• gonads
• corpus luteum
• placenta
•All steroid hormones are
derivatives of
cholesterol.
•Cholesterol is modified:
• Removal of side chain.
• Addition of side chain.
• Hydroxylation.
• Aromatization.
• Steroid hormones diffuse
into the circulation as
they are synthesized
• Secretory rates correlate
with rate of synthesis

Thyroid Hormones
Hormone Half-life and Circulation
•T4: circulation ½ life of 7 days
•Glucocorticoids vary
•Protein hormones usually have short
halves lifes (<20 minutes)
•Rapid hormone degradation can be useful
•i.e. removal of a parathyroid adenoma
Clinical Example:
Clinical Example:
• Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is
a peptide hormone.
• It is synthesized and stored in
vesicles in the chief cells of the
parathyroid gland.
• Stimulus for PTH secretion is
low extracellular calcium
concentration.
• When sensors on the
parathyroid gland detect a low
extracellular calcium
concentration, the secretory
vesicles are translocated to the
cell membrane, and PTH is
released into the blood by
exocytosis.
Clinical Application:
•½ life of PTH is ~ 5
minutes
• Surgeons take
advantage of this short
½ life in the OR
•Draw PTH levels at:
• Baseline
• Pre-excision
• Various other time points
•Intra-op levels should
fall by 50%
Time PTH
0 120
pre-excision 140

10 20
20 20
Hormone Circulation
•Many hormones circulate in association with serum
binding proteins
• T4 and T3 with thyroid binding globulin (TBG)
• cortisol to cortisol binding globulin (CBG)
• androgen and estrogen with sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG)
• calcium with albumin
•It is the free portion that is often physiologically
active

Hormone Action Through Receptors
•Membrane Receptors
•Peptide hormones
•Cathecholamines
•Nuclear Receptors
•Small molecules that can diffuse
across cell membrane
•Thyroid hormone
•Steroids
•Vitamin D
G-Protein Coupled Receptors:
•G proteins are a family of membrane-bound
proteins that couple hormone receptors to
effector enzymes
•G proteins serve as “molecular switches”
that decide whether the hormone action can
proceed

G-Protein Coupled Receptors:
ATP cAMP
Mechanisms of Hormone Action:
The 3 major mechanisms of hormone
action on the target cells are:
• Adenylyl cyclase mechanism
• cAMP is the second messenger
• Phospholipase C mechanism
• IP3 / Ca2+ is the second messenger
• Steroid hormone mechanism
Hormone Action
•In addition:
•Insulin and Insulin-Like Growth Factors
(IGF) act on their target cells through a
tyrosine kinase mechanism
•Several hormones activate guanylate
cyclase, in which cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) is the second
messenger

•Clinical Relevance
Regulation of Hormone Synthesis:
•Maintain homeostasis.
•Adjustments in secretory rates.
•Neural mechanisms:
• Secretion of catecholamines: preganglionic
sympathetic nerves synapse on the adrenal
medulla and when stimulated cause secretion of
catecholamines into the circulation.
•Feedback mechanisms:
• Positive and Negative feedback.
•Negative feedback is the most important and
most common mechanism.
Feedback
•Negative feedback:
•Some feature of hormone action, directly
or indirectly, inhibits further secretion of
the hormone.
•Positive feedback:
•Uncommon.
•Some feature of hormone action causes
more secretion of the hormone.
Negative
Feedback:
•Hormone levels are
judged to be adequate
or high, further
secretion is inhibited.
•When hormone
levels are judged to be
inadequate or low,
secretion of the
hormone is
stimulated.
•Examples:
•Testosterone
•Insulin
•During follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle, the
ovaries secrete estrogen.
•Estrogen acts on the
anterior pituitary to
produce a rapid burst of

Iodine Fortification: A Public Health
Success
● Iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function; deficiency
can lead to goiter, hypothyroidism, or intellectual disability
● Prior to the 1920’s, iodine deficiency was so prevalent in
the Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Pacific Northwest
regions of the U.S., the area was termed the “Goiter Belt”
● Dr. David Murray Cowie, a pediatrician at the University of
Michigan, urged the US to add sodium iodide to
commercial table salt, and by 1924 Morton Salt Company
began selling it nationally
● Although most Americans now receive adequate dietary
iodine, and the “Goiter Belt” no longer exists iodine
deficiency remains a problem globally, and is a significant
priority of the W.H.O.
Leung et al., Nutrients, 2012.
Disease Prevalence in US
Diabetes Mellitus •25.8 million children and adults
•8.3% of the population—have diabetes
Hyperlipidemia 20-25%
Hypothyroidism 5-10% of women, 0.5-2% of men
Graves’ disease 1-3% of women, 0.1% of men
Osteoporosis •10 million with osteoporosis
•34 million with low bone mass
•$25,000,000,000 estimated cost
osteoporotic related fractures by the year
2025
Hyperparathyroidism 0.1-0.5% , women>men
Infertility 10% of couples




The Real Cost of Insulin
● Over the past decade, the price of insulin has risen sharply in the
US, out of proportion with the rate of inflation
○ Out of pocket costs rose 10% per year for insulin using
Medicare Pt D enrollees between 2006 and 2013
● Nearly 1 in 4 patients at an urban diabetes center reported costrelated insulin underusage--ie trying to “make a vial last longer”-
-and this was associated with worse glycemic control

PREGNANCY CONFIRMATION
Urine pregnancy test:
- detect beta- hCG levels (>20 mUI/ml)
- qualitative test
Serum hCG (aka serum beta)
- qualitative test or quantitative
Pregnancy location:
Intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)
 10-20% of known pregnancies result in
miscarriage
Extrauterine pregnancy = ectopic
pregnancy
 Approximately 1-2% of pregnancies

PREGNANCY DATING
• 280 days (40 wks) from LMP
• 266 days (38 weeks) from
fertilization
Average
pregnancy:
• Assumes 28-day cycle with
ovulation on day 14
• EDD is calculated using first day of
LMP (day 1 of cycle)
• 2 weeks prior to OVULATION
• Approximately 50% of pregnant
individuals can accurately recall
LMP3
”Traditional
Dating” =
Gestational
Age https://www.prokerala.com/health/pregnancy/pregnancy-wheel/
PREGNANCY
DATING: CORE
PRINCIPLES
(ACOG)
1. Ultrasound prior to 13+6 weeks gestation is most
accurate way to establish or confirm gestational age
2. If using ART, assign based on ART-transfer date (ie
date of transfer of Day three embryo)
3. Don’t change an EDD once it is established
4. Pregnancy “dated” after 22 weeks = suboptimally
dated
ULTRASOUND DATING CONFIRMATION
- Dating is obtained through
measurements of different things
depending on age of pregnancy
- Crown rump length (CRL) prior to 14
wks
- Fetal biometry after 14 wks
 Average of 4 measurements
 Biparietal diameter
 Head circumference
 Abdominal circumference
 Femur length

Thyroid Anatomy
Thyroid Structure
The functional units of the thyroid gland are thyroid follicles (F), spheroid structures
filled with colloid, a gel matrix where thyroid hormone is made and stored. Each
follicle is surrounded by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells called follicular cells
which trap iodine and make thyroid hormone precursors.
Source: Wheater’s Functional Histology, 3rd Ed. 1993, p309
Thyroid Structure: Follicles
Thyroid follicles (F) are surrounded by epithelium called follicular cells. Inside the
lumen is colloid, a gel matrix where thyroid hormone is synthesized and stored.
Capillaries (C) occupy the space between follicles, allowing thyroid hormone to diffuse
directly into the bloodstream when needed.

Iodine
Sources of Iodine
• Seafood
• Seaweed/kelp
• Dairy
• Iodized salt
(not: kosher salt, sea salt,
processed foods)
• Enriched bread
• Available Iodine: rate limiting
step for thyroid hormone
synthesis
• Iodate in salt is reduced in gut
and absorbed as iodide
• Iodide is rapidly absorbed in
stomach and duodenum,
oxidized to Iodine in thyroid
How much do you need?
WHO:
• 150mcg/d (>12yo)
• 250mcg/d for pregnancy/lactation
– PNV should contain 150mcg
• Upper limit: 1100mcg/d
RDA for Iodine Foods with Iodine
*250mcg for pregnancy
IOM:
Most of the iodine in the American diet is added as a nutritional supplement
Kelp, the most iodine-rich of all foods
Iodine deficiency
• Affects up to 2 billion people worldwide
• Needed for fetal/infant brain myelination
• Infants/children: cretinism/ impaired cognitive
development, growth retardation
• Adults: causes goiter

Why give KI
in nuclear accidents/fallout?
• Nuclear reactor: releases Radioactive Iodine
(RAI)
• Thyroid takes up RAI avidly (esp if iodinedeficient) >> high risk of thyroid cancer
• Administering KI: quickly saturates iodine
binding sites, blocking uptake of RAI

Summary: Synthesis and Peripheral Metabolism of Thyroid Hormones
• All the steps in the synthesis and release of the
thyroid hormones are controlled by TSH
• Thyroid hormone production can be conceptualized as
occurring in 3 steps:
1) Iodine transport (rate limiting step)
2) Oxidation, organification, coupling (controlled by TPO)
3) Proteolysis and release
Summary: Synthesis and Peripheral Metabolism of Thyroid Hormones
• T4 and T3 are stored as Thyroglobulin (T4:T3 = 14:1)
• Peripheral metabolism of the thyroid hormones is
controlled by deiodinases (DIO)
• T4 to T3 conversion (activation) in liver and kidney by
D1 is an important control point in thyroid metabolism
• Reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is a
common clinical occurrence in euthyroid patients (e.g.
euthyroid sick syndrome)

Log-linear Relationship between Plasma TSH and Free T4
[Small change in T4à Large change in TSH]
TSH: Separates primary pathologies = good screening test
Thyroid status is defined by the
level of the free thyroid hormones
THYROID FUNCTION TESTS
(TFTs)
àAsk: taking Biotin? Hold for 3 days (up to 10gm)
• Many assays use biotin to measure TSH and T4;
results may be inaccurate
Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):
• We can measure: TSH, Total T4 & T3, Free T4 & T3
• Blood levels of T4 and T3 can change due to:
– changes in secretion (thyroid problem)
– levels of binding proteins (non thyroid problem)
*Total T4 and T3 measures bound + unbound T4 and T3)
• Serum TSH is the most sensitive thyroid function test
• Thyroid status is defined by the level of the free thyroid hormones,
usually Free T4 is sufficient.

Points about Free hormones:
1. ‘Free T4 & Free T3’ can be measured in the lab,
but still subject to binding protein abnormalities
2. True Free T4 and FT3: via equilibrium dialysis
(costly, labor intensive, slow)
3. Free T4 can be estimated by measuring Total T4
and T3RU (resin uptake) and calculating FTI (Free
Thyroxine Index)
4. Mostly we just order #1, but use #2 and #3 if
possible binding problems

Treatment of Hyperthyroidism
Inhibiting Secretion of Thyroid Hormone
• Iodine
– Blocks secretion of thyroid hormone: used acutely where
rapid control is needed (thyroid storm)
– Inhibits organification temporarily (Wolf-Chaikoff effect)
– Reduces vascularity of the thyroid: preop
• Lithium
– Blocks secretion of thyroid hormone
– May result in hypothyroidism in euthyroid patients
Symptom Relief of Hyperthyroidism
• Beta-adrenergic antagonists
• Calcium channel blockers
Beta-blockers
• Alleviate many hyperadrenergic symptoms
• Reduce T4 à T3 conversion (hi dose propranolol)

Conflict of Interests
• NONE
TEACHING OBJECTIVES
• 1. What are goiters?
– How are they classified?
– How and why do they occur?
• 2. How do we evaluate goiters?
– Clinically?
– Radiographically?
• 3. How do we treat goiters?
– Benign vs malignant
CASE
• A 25 year old woman with no
significant past history is referred to
you in your endocrinology office after
her primary care doctor feels a nodule
on exam.
GOITER
• Enlarged thyroid
• Anatomical classification
– Diffuse: often evolves into nodular goiter
– Nodular: solitary nodule vs. multinodular
• Functional classification
– Non-toxic: does not cause hyperthyroidism
– Toxic: causes hyperthyroidism
• Pathological classification
– Benign (90-95%)
– Malignant (5-10%)
MECHANISMS
• Normal thyroid tissue:
– TSH regulates growth and cellular differentiation
• Diffuse goiter:
– Growth factors (TSH or TSI) stimulate cell growth (hyperplasia)
– Genetic mutations (increased sensitivity to TSH) or goitrogenic
substances (impair TH synthesis) likely involved
• Nodular goiter:
– Hyperplastic cells can involute and fibrose
– Malignant transformation less commonly occurs
NON-TOXIC GOITERS
• Enlarged thyroid gland without hyperthyroidism
– No signs/symptoms hyperthyroidism, TSH normal or high
– May be diffuse or nodular
• Examples:
– Simple goiter: not caused by inflammation or neoplasm
– Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis)
– Other infiltrative diseases (thyroiditis, cancer)
– Congenital
– Physiologic goiter of puberty
SIMPLE GOITER: ENDEMIC
• Increased prevalence in a geographic area
• > 10% in schoolchildren
• > 5% in the total population
• Most common cause goiter worldwide (200 million cases)
• Typically caused by nutritional iodine deficiency
• Iodine: substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis
• Deficiency causes low T4/T3, stimulates TSH
• Recommended daily iodine intake: 150 mcg
• Supplementing food supply has largely eradicated in US
SIMPLE GOITER: ENDEMIC
Iodine deficiency leads to
decreased T4/T3 synthesis
Compensatory response by
pituitary increases TSH
TSH causes hyperplasia
Nodules develops over time
SIMPLE GOITER: SPORADIC
• Spontaneously arising goiters in iodine sufficient areas
– More common in US
– Diffuse or nodular goiter
• Etiology:
• Environmental Factors
– Smoking
– Drugs (lithium)
– Natural goitrogens (toxins, foods that suppress iodine uptake)
– Radiation to head and neck
• Genetics
HASHIMOTO’S THYROIDITIS
• Diffuse or nodular goiter in iodine sufficient region
– Common cause in US (approximately 3/1000 cases)
– More common in women
• Autoimmune disease
– Infiltration of lymphocytes leads to inflammation and fibrosis
– Insidious process with slow progression to hypothyroidism
• TSH stimulation leads to further enlargement thyroid
NODULES
• Nodular goiter common
– 4-6% patients with palpable nodule, > 50% on U/S or autopsy
– More common in women, incidence increases with age
• Most nodules remain stable in size and function
– Over 10 year period 15% of nodules will increase in size
– 10% incidence hyperthyroidism during a 12 year follow-up
– Insidious process with prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism
• Small percentage are malignant (5-10%)
Back to Our Patient
• She comes to your office where you do a careful
history and exam.
– She denies any weight changes, cold or heat
intolerance, or other symptoms of thyroid disease.
– She denies any SOB, cough, or problems swallowing.
– On exam she is noted to have thyromegly.
CLINICAL EVALUATION
• Assess for symptoms/signs of hyperthyroidism
– Weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, tremor, brisk
reflexes
• Assess for symptoms of goiter
– Compressive symptoms (SOB, cough, dysphagia)
– Hoarseness or sudden pain
• Palpate thyroid gland:
– Is goiter diffuse or nodular? Uninodular or multinodular?
– Are nodules hard, fixed or tender?
CANCER RISK FACTORS
• Patient characteristics:
– Male gender or Age < 20 yrs or > 60 yrs
– Radiation exposure or family history of thyroid cancer
• Nodule characteristics
– Firm, fixed nodule and/or rapid growth
• Clinical characteristics
– Hoarseness or vocal cord paralysis
– Regional lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes)
FURTHER EVALUATION
• Laboratory
– TSH on every patient (rule out toxic goiter)
• Imaging
– Ultrasonography: most common modality used
– Radioactive iodine scan
– CT or PET-scan: rarely needed
• Fine needle aspiration biopsy
– Not necessary on every nodule (5-10% malignant)
Back to Our Patient
• Her FH is significant for her mother having
hypothyroidism and being on levothyroxine.
• Her TSH is drawn and it is 2.5.
• She denies any radiation exposures and she eats
a regular diet.
• On exam the nodule is fixed and firm and ~3cms.
Back To Our Patient
• Given that our patient has a normal TSH and a
palpable nodule on exam what is the next step?
ULTRASONOGRAPHY (US)
• Most important imaging modality for nodular goiter
• Provides high resolution imaging
– Estimates size of gland and evaluates for presence of nodules
– Helps distinguish between solid and cystic nodules
– Helps distinguish between benign and malignant nodules
– Provides guidance for fine needle biopsies
• Does not use ionizing radiation

US FEATURES OF NODULES
BENIGN
• Iso or hyperechogenic
• Coarse calcifications
• Thin, well defined halo
• Regular margins
• No invasive growth
• Normal lymph nodes
• Normal vascularity
MALIGNANT
• Hypoechogenic
• Microcalcifications
• Thick, irregular or absent halo
• Irregular margins
• Invasive growth
• Regional lymph nodes
• Increased vascularity
HALO SIGN
MICROCALCIFICATIONS
INCREASED VASCULARITY
THYROID SCAN
• Measures radioactive iodine uptake in thyroid
• Typically performed in patients with low TSH
• Used to evaluate cause of hyperthyroidism or to
assess functional status of nodules
FUNCTIONING NODULE ON SCAN
Called a “hot nodule”
Area of increased iodine
uptake in functional nodule
Uptake may reveal isolated
or multiple nodules
Risk of malignancy very low
in hot nodules
BIOPSY?
• Diffuse Goiter:
• Not typically performed
• Nodular Goiter:
• Single nodule:
– If TSH is low obtain uptake, consider FNA of “cold” nodules
– If small (<1.0 cm) or non-concerning features on U/S observe
– If larger or increased concern for malignancy then biopsy
• Multinodular:
– If TSH is low obtain uptake, consider FNA of “cold” nodules
– Biopsy dominant or concerning nodules > 1 cm

Surgical Considerations
• Reasons for surgery:
– Positive biopsy, rapid decompression vital structures,
pathological examination, hyperthyroidism, cosmetic
• Types of surgery:
– Total, subtotal or hemi-thyroidectomy
• Major Risks:
– Mortality (<1%)
– Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1-2%)
– Hypoparathyroidism (0.5-5%)
– Hypothyroidism (10-100%)
Back to our Patient
• She is found to have a 3cm nodule with
microcalcifications.
• She is referred for Fine Needle Aspiration.

Corrected Calcium
• Corrected calcium (albumin-corrected calcium)
– For every gram the serum albumin is below 4.0, add 0.8 mg to
the total serum calcium
– Opposite correction for high albumin is not so well validated
• Recommend: measure ionized calcium
Corrected Calcium = Total Calcium + [(4.0 - Serum Albumin) x 0.8]
Corrected Calcium = Total Calcium - [(Serum Albumin - 4.0) x 0.8]
Example of influence of serum
albumin on total calcium
• 60 y/o man with cirrhotic liver failure
– Total serum calcium measured
• 7.8 mg/dl (Normal 8.5-10.2)
– Albumin 2.8 mg/dl
– Corrected calcium:
• 7.8+ [(4.0 – 2.8) x 0.8] = 8.76 (normal)
– Implies ionized calcium is normal
• Measured ionized calcium is normal
– Dx: Pseudohypocalcemia
Serum Calcium Measurement: Acidemia
• Changes in acid-base status change ionized calcium by
changing the fraction of calcium bound to albumin

A Brief Detour – The Skeleton
The Skeleton – What is It?
• Bone is a connective tissue that consists of cells and a
specialized extracellular collagenous matrix with the
capacity to become calcified
Osteoclasts
Mineralized Bone
Unmineralized Osteoid (Red)
Osteoblasts
Mineralized Bone (Green)
Marrow
The Skeleton - Function
• Support/Mechanical
– Provide shape & ability to move
• Protective
– brain, heart, lungs, etc.
• Metabolic
– Dynamic not static
With Skeleton Without Skeleton
3 Types of Bone Cells
• Osteoclasts
– Break down bone
– Release calcium and phosphate into ECF
• Osteoblasts
– Synthesize collagen
– Mineralize collagen
• Osteocytes
– Mature osteoblasts surrounded by the matrix they’ve secreted,
bathed in ECF
– Mechanoreceptor and transducers, linked to other osteocytes
– Conduit through which Ca & PO4 flow between bone and ECF
Three major functions of bone cells
1. Dictate the development of bone’s shape and structure
over the lifespan, a process called “modeling”
2. Bone remodeling – process of bone resorption and
formation
3. Participate in normal Ca & PO4 balance
Bone Remodeling Cycle
Resorption by osteoclasts, formation by osteoblasts
1. Quiescence
2. Activation
3. Resorption 4. Reversal 5. Formation
• Resorption and
formation are
coupled via
Receptor activator
of nuclear factor
kappa-B
(RANK)/RANK
ligand system
RANK and RANKL
●Bone formation and resorption
normally are linked
●RANK ligand made by osteoblasts
● Binds to RANK on pre-osteoclasts
● Binding causes maturation and
Increased activity of osteoclasts
● OPG is a decoy receptor that blocks
Interaction of RANK and RANKL
● Ratio of OPG to RANKL dictates
extent of bone resorption
Hormonal Regulation of
Calcium
Calciotropic Hormones
Parathyroid Hormone [PTH]
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]
Calcitonin
Parathyroid Hormone
• 84 amino acid polypeptide
• Synthesized by 4 parathyroid
glands located near the thyroid
gland
• After secretion, cleaved at amino
acid 36 in the liver & kidney
• Activity resides in the first 34
amino acids
• Intact 1-84 peptide, 1-34 and 1-36
are active
PTH Function and Regulation
• Function: maintain serum calcium in normal range
–When plasma calcium falls  PTH is secreted
–PTH acts on organs directly or indirectly to restore
calcium to normal
• Serum ionized Ca - primary regulator of
PTH synthesis & secretion
• Fall in serum ionized Ca
immediate release of PTH
rise in ionized Ca
• Rise in serum ionized Ca
immediate suppression of PTH
release
fall in ionized Ca
Mechanism of Calcium
Sensing and PTH Secretion
• Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)
on parathyroid membrane
• 7 transmemberane receptor
coupled by G protein (Gq) to
phospholipase C
• Principle regulator of PTH
secretion
• Widely expressed

Mechanism of PTH Secretion
• Rise in extracellular ionized
calcium
– Increased binding to the CaSR
– Activation of phospholipase C
– Increased ionized calcium INSIDE
the parathyroid cell
– Leads to production arachidonic acid
– Inhibition of PTH secretion
PTH Receptor
• PTH binds to PTH receptor
• PTH is a 7 transmembrane
G-coupled receptor
• Activates adenylate cyclase
• Increased cAMP
• Stimulates protein kinase A
• Leads to phosphorylation of
proteins
– Activation/changes in
transcription
Parathyroid Hormone: Target Organs
• Intestine (Indirect)
– PTH stimulates transcription 1α-hydroxylase in
the kidney 1,25(OH)2D  Ca absorption
• Kidney (Direct)
– Increased activation and expression TRPV5 in
distal nephron
– Increased expression calbindin, NCX, PMCA
– Also affects charge in lumen  increase ca
reabsorption
• All lead to increased re-absorption of renal calcium
• Bone (Direct  see next slide)
PTH: Target Organs - Bone
• PTH binds to receptor on
osteoblasts (not osteoclasts)
• Increases RANKL
– Reduces OPG
• RANKL binds to RANK
receptor on pre-osteoclasts
• Mature osteoclasts formed
and activated
• Calcium released from
skeleton as bone is resorbed
CaSR
Hormonal Regulation of Calcium by PTH -
Overview
• Low calcium is sensed by the
parathyroid cell via CaSR→ PTH release
• PTH mobilizes calcium from bone
• PTH increases calcium resorption
from the kidney
• PTH stimulates expression of the
1-α-hydroxylase → converts 25OHD
to 1,25(OH)2D
• 1,25(OH)2D promotes Ca absorption
From the GI tract
• These actions restore serum
calcium to normal
Calciotropic Hormones
Parathyroid Hormone [PTH]
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]
Calcitonin
Vitamin D
• Fat soluble steroid hormone
• Not a vitamin!!
– Made from cholesterol
– Biologically inert prohormone
– 2 hydroxylations to become biologically active
• Sources of Vitamin D
– D3 (cholecalciferol)
– Fatty fish, cod liver oil
– Can be made from 7-dehydrocholesterol with UVB exposure
– D2 (ergocalciferol)
– Plants and yeasts, used to fortify cereal, milk, bread
• Recommended Daily Allowance: 400-1000 IU
• Actions increase serum calcium and promote mineralization of
osteoid
Synthesis of Vitamin D
• Circulates in blood bound to
vitamin D binding protein
• D2 & D3 transported to liver
• Liver
– Hydroxylated by CYP27A1 at C25
yielding relatively inert 25OHD
– Serum 25OHD measures body
stores of vitamin D
• Kidney
– May be hydroxylated at C1 by
CYP27B1 (1α hydroxylase) yielding
biologically active 1,25(OH)2D
or
– at C24 by CYP24A1 yielding
biologically inert 24,25(OH) 2D
Regulation of Vitamin D Synthesis
• Whether the kidney makes 1,25(OH)2D or
24,25(OH)2D depends on whether the body
has enough calcium to meet its needs
– 1,25(OH)2D synthesized if calcium supplies low
– 24,25(OH)2D synthesized if calcium supplies
adequate
Regulation of 1α Hydroxylase
• PTH
– Directly stimulates renal 1,25(OH)2D production by increasing
expression of the 1α hydroxylase
• Serum calcium
– Low serum calcium stimulates 1α hydroxylase primarily by
increasing PTH secretion
• FGF-23 – Inhibits expression of 1α hydroxylase
– Promotes expression of 24-alpha hydroxylase (CYP24A1)
• 1,25 (OH)2D – Binds to receptors in parathyroid cells, INHIBITS PTH
secretion
– Increases transcription of 24-alpha hydroxylase
– Inhibits expression 1-alpha hydroxylase
Actions of Vitamin D
• Binds to nuclear receptor for vitamin D (VDR) and forms
heterodimer with retinoid x receptor
• Binds hormone response element
• Alters transcription of genes
Targets of Vitamin D
• Target Organs:
– Intestine – increase calcium absorption by increasing TRPV6,
PMCA expression
– Bone – increase calcium release by increasing bone resorption
but mechanism unclear; also increased bone
formation/mineralization but in hypocalcemia resorption >
formation
– Kidney -- increase calcium resorption by increasing TRPV5 and
calbindin expression; (in some circumstances may also increase
urine calcium)
– NET EFFECT: increase serum calcium
Calciotropic Hormones
Parathyroid Hormone
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D
Calcitonin
Calcitonin
• 32 amino acid peptide
hormone
• Parafollicular C cells of
the thyroid
• Stored in secretory
granules
• Major stimulus - rise in
plasma Ca
Actions of Calcitonin
1. Inhibits osteoclastic bone
resorption
2. Increases urinary calcium
excretion
• Uncertain role in normal
physiology
– Neither high or low levels affect
calcium metabolism
• Mainly used as a therapy for
– Hypercalcemia
– Osteoporosis (historically)
No calcitonin
Calcitonin exposure
-temporarily inactivates
Regulation of Phosphorus
Hormones and Factors Involved in
Phosphate Regulation
Phosphate
PTH
Vitamin D
FGF-23
Phosphate regulation of
phosphate
• Low dietary phosphate or low
serum phosphate
– Increases renal Npt2a
expression and insertion into
renal proximal tubule
– Effect: more phosphate reabsorption from kidney and
lower urinary phosphate levels
– Phosphate sensing
mechanisms unclear
PTH regulation of phosphate
• Direct phosphate sensor in parathyroid
proposed but not identified
– High PO4 may stimulate PTH indirectly by lowering
calcium
• Low calcium main stimulus for PTH, causing
secondary phosphaturia
• Gut: Indirect effect by increasing 1,25(OH)2D
 increase PO4 absorption
• Bone: bone resorption  increase
phosphate release
• Kidney: PTH causes Na+-PO4 cotransporter
to localize to cytosol from luminal membrane
of proximal nephron
• Decreased renal phosphate
reabsorption
• Increased renal phosphate losses
in urine
PTH excess states: renal effects predominate  low or low-nl PO4
FGF-23
• A “phosphatonin”
• Hormone controlling phosphate balance
• Secreted by osteoblasts/-cytes in bone
• Increases renal PO4 excretion
• Decreased localization NPT2a to luminal membrane
• Decrease expression 1-α hydroxylase
• Decrease 1,25(OH)2D synthesis  decreased phosphate GI absorption
and renal reabsorption
• Too much FGF23 – hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, muscle
weakness
• Too little FGF23 – hyperphosphatemia, soft tissue calcification
• FGF-23 increases in renal failure with reduced filtration of
phosphate
• Other phosphatonins exist but exact roles in normal phosphate
metabolism unclear
Vitamin D regulation of Phosphate by
Targets
• Not completely understood !!
• If you are confused, so is the rest of the world!
• Gut: 1,25(OH)2D thought to ? increase NPT2b transporter
expression  increased phosphate absorption
• Kidney: 1,25(OH)2D ? increases expression renal NPT2 
?? reabsoprtion
• Bone: 1,25(OH)2D stimulates bone resorption > formation
when phos low
• Net Effect  increase serum phosphate
Overview of phosphate metabolism
High
phosphate
↑ PTH ↑ FGF-23
↑ Calcitriol ↑ ↓ Calcitriol
phosphate
excretion
-
When serum phosphate is high
PTH and FGF-23 increase
They both act on the kidney to
cause phosphaturia
They have opposing effects on
calcitriol
Net effect: increased phosphate
excretion
FGF-23, PTH, 1,25OHD regulate
Each other

Disorders of Bone and Mineral Metabolism
Disorder Pathophysiology Effect
Osteoporosis Imbalance bone resorption and bone
formation
• Deterioration of skeletal microstructure
• Does not cause hypercalcemia
Primary Hyperparathyroidism Parathyroid adenoma produces
excess PTH
• Increased PTH and serum calcium, low
or low-normal phosphate, high urine
calcium
Hypoparathyroidism Lack of PTH • Low serum calcium, high phosphate,
high urine calcium
Vitamin D deficiency (low
intake or absorption)
Decreased GI calcium and
phosphate absorption
• Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
• Low serum calcium and phosphate and
osteomalacia (impaired skeletal
mineralization) if severe and prolonged
Tumor Induced Osteomalacia Tumor produces ectopic FGF-23 • Phosphaturia, low serum phosphate,
osteomalacia
Humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy
Tumors produce PTH-RP • High calcium, low phosphate
Hematoloical malignancies Unrestrained 1α hydroxylase activity
in lymphocytes (lymphoma)
• High 1,25OHD, hypercalcemia
Familial Hypocalciuric
Hypercalcemia (FHH)
Mutation in CASR decreases
sensitivity of receptor/perceived lack
of calcium
• High serum calcium and
inappropriately normal PTH, low urine
calcium
Summary
• Calcium and phosphate are critical to many
cellular functions
– Maintaining normal serum levels is important
• The hormonal regulation of calcium depends on
PTH (and vitamin D) and key organs including the
gut, kidney and bone
• The hormonal regulation of phosphate occurs via
PTH, vitamin D and FGF-23 and their actions on
gut, kidney and bone

Primary
Hyperparathyroidism
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
 Characterized by incompletely
regulated, chronic, excessive
secretion of parathyroid
hormone from one or more
parathyroid glands.
 Primary hyperparathyroidism is
associated with hypercalcemia
and elevated levels of
parathyroid hormone.
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
• Epidemiology
– Prevalence 1/1,000
– Most common in women
• 3:1 Female : Male predominance
– Often presents in early post-menopause
• Cause
– Solitary parathyroid adenoma, 80%
– 4 gland parathyroid hyperplasia, 10-15%
– Multiple adenomas, 2-5%
– Parathyroid carcinoma, <1 %
Regulation of PTH Secretion
PHPT:
• Loss of normal feedback of
calcium to completely
suppress PTH
• Due to increased
parathyroid cell mass and
reduced number of calcium
sensing receptors on
parathyroid cells within the
adenoma

Guidelines for Parathyroid Surgery
Hypercalcemia of
Malignancy
Hypercalcemia of Malignancy
• Common in patients with malignancy
– Occurs in 20-30%
– Breast, renal, lung cancer and multiple myeloma
are the most common malignancies causing
hypercalcemia
– Typically a late stage manifestation of
malignancy
• i.e. malignancy is usually clinically obvious by the
time hypercalcemia occurs
Hypercalcemia of Malignancy
Biochemical pattern
characterized by
• High calcium
• Suppressed PTH
Main Mechanisms for Hypercalcemia of
Malignancy
• Humoral Hypercalcemia of Malignancy (HHM), ~80%
• Tumor secretes parathyroid hormone related peptide or
PTHrP
• Squamous cell, renal, etc.
• Osteolytic metastases, ~20%
• Breast cancer, multiple myeloma, etc.
• Tumor production of calcitriol
• Lymphoma
• (Ectopic production of PTH is rare & case-reportable)
PTH-Related Protein (PTHrP)
• Has homology with PTH
– 8 of first 13 amino acids
identical
• Circulating levels in
normal adult negligible
– Not known to play a role in
normal adult calcium
metabolism
PTH-RP
• Normally critical in
– Embryogenesis and development
– Transfer of calcium to breast milk
– Paracrine functions in adult
• In HHM circulating levels of PTHrP are high
• PTHrP binds to PTH1 receptor
• Has actions similar to PTH
• Hypercalcemia
• Bone resorption
• Increased renal calcium reabsorption
• Phosphaturia
• Does not cause increase in 1-α-hydroxylase
• Not detected in intact PTH assay!
Hormone affects nearby cells
Humoral Hypercalcemia (PTHrP)
• Squamous cell carcinomas
• Renal carcinomas
• Bladder carcinoma
• Breast cancer
• Ovarian cancer
• Adult T-cell lymphoma*
• Leukemia*
• CML
*Hypercalcemia in HTLV-associated lymphoma/leukemia often associated
with this mechanism
Osteolytic Metastases
• Tumor cells metastatic to bone
increase bone resorption by
– Producing local PTHrP, IL-6, and MCSF, which increase osteoclast
formation
– Inducing bone marrow stromal cells
and osteocytes to increase RANKL
and decrease OPG
– Inducing adipocytes to make
cytokines that increase osteoclast
formation and enhance tumor growth
• Increased bone resorption
releases growth factors from
bone that increase tumor growth
• "Vicious cycle" of tumor cells
increasing bone resorption that in
turn increases tumor growth in
bone
• Cause of hypercalcemia in Hodgkin lymphoma and
many non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients
• Production 1,25(OH)2D via 1-α-hydroxylase in
kidney normal tightly controlled
• Malignant lymphocytes induce unrestrained
production of 1,25(OH)2D by neighboring
macrophages
– Not responsive to normal feedback mechanisms
• High 1,25(OH)2D causes
– Increased intestinal absorption
– May cause increased bone resorption
– Results in hypercalcemia
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production
Diagnostic Approach to Hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia Causes
PTH-mediated
PHPT
NON PTH-mediated
Malignancy >> Everything else
Most cases of hypercalcemia (~90%) caused by PHPT and Malignancy
General principal of the diagnostic approach is to distinguish between the two
So what is the first and single most
important test to be ordered ??
Degree and duration of hypercalcemia also helpful:
Mild, long duration, asymptomatic: Likely PHPT
Marked, new onset, sick: Malignancy more likely
Diagnostic Approach to Hypercalcemia F
Elevated calcium
Measure PTH
Elevated Mid-upper or
minimally elevated
Low (<20 pg/ml)
PHPT
Elevated 1,25D
Measure PTHrP and
vitamin D metabolites
Non-PTH mediated

At What Level Should Hypercalcemia F
Be Treated Emergently?
• < 12 mg/dL ?
Avoid thiazides, lithium, volume depletion,
immobility, high calcium diet
• 12-14 mg/dL ?
Treat if symptomatic
• >14 mg/dL ?
Generally treat
• Lower calcium
– Increase renal excretion
– Decrease bone resorption
– Decrease GI absorption
• Treat underlying cause
Management of Hypercalcemia:
General Measures
• Intravenous rehydration with saline
administration
– Initial rate of 200 to 300 mL/hour then adjusted to maintain
the urine output at 100 to 150mL/hour
– Increases calcium excretion
• Diuresis with furosemide after patient is euvolemic! (Fallen out of favor)
– Particularly in those with propensity for volume overload
– Increases calcium excretion
• Mobilization if possible
Management of Hypercalcemia:
General Measures
• Osteoclast inhibitor
• Calciuretic
• 4 IU/kg IM or SC, q12 hours
• Rapid reduction in calcium of 1-2
mg/dL (within 4-6 hours)
• Weak and short-lived effect
(tachiphylaxis)
Management of Hypercalcemia:
Calcitonin
Combination Therapy For
Hypercalcemia
• Use of a rapidly acting agent (calcitonin)
• Simultaneous with a more potent, but more
slowly acting agent (bisphosphonate)

Bisphosphonates for hypercalcemia
Management of Hypercalcemia Management of Hypercalcemia:
Bisphosphonates
• Osteoclast inhibitors  decrease bone resorption
• IV zoledronic acid (4 mg IV) or IV pamidronate (60-90
mg IV)
• zoledronic acid preferred - more potent
• Effective in hypercalcemia in which bone resorption
plays some role
• Maximum effect in 2-4 days; duration 2-4 wks
• Usually given with saline and/or calcitonin (which
reduce calcium faster)
• Mild, transient fever
• Impaired renal function
• Hypocalcemia (“overshoot”)
• Small reduction in the serum
phosphate
• Osteonecrosis of the jaw
Adverse Effects of Pamidronate and
Zoledronic Acid
Note: can be used with impaired renal function, but lower dose and/or
slower infusion
Management of Hypercalcemia:
Glucocorticoids
• Effective for increased absorption of dietary
calcium due to excess D or calcitriol (sarcoid,
lymphoma)
• Prednisone 20-40 mg/d
• Reduction in serum calcium in 2-5 days
Management of Hypercalcemia:
Other Options
• Denosumab 120 mg SQ
• Now approved for hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory
to bisphosphonate rx
• Can be used in renal impairment
• not cleared by kidney and doesn’t cause renal
impairment
• With renal impairment hypocalcemia might occur, so
consider lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) and check for D
adequacy
• Dialysis (if necessary)
• Cinacalcet – used for parathyroid cancer, approved
for PHPT but rarely used/indicated
Hypocalcemia
What is Hypocalcemia ?
• A condition in which the blood calcium
level is below normal
– Usually due to disorder of PTH or vitamin D
– Mechanisms include
• Decreased absorption of calcium
• Loss of calcium from the circulation (binding,
redistribution)
• Reduced bone resorption
Clinical Manifestations of Hypocalcemia
• Absolute serum calcium
concentration
• Rate of decline
• Duration/Chronicity
Change in MS Asymptomatic

• Seizures
• Mental status changes –
confusion, irritability,
anxiety, psychosis, coma
Hallmark Manifestations of
Hypocalcemia
Neuromuscular Irritability/Tetany*:
*Low extracellular calcium  Membrane potential less negative  less amount of depolarization needed to activate action potential  increased excitability
Signs of Hypocalcemia
Chvostek’s Trousseau’s
Induction of carpopedal spasm (painful)
by ischemia
Contraction of facial muscles
elicited by tapping on facial nerve
Cardiac Changes
• Bradycardia
• Impaired contractility/CHF
• Prolongation of the QT interval  Torsade
• Arrythmia

hypoparathyroidism
Usually secondary
hyperparathyroidism
Causes of Hypocalcemia – High PTH
I. Vitamin D disorders
A. Vitamin D deficiency (Secondary HPT)
1) Low vitamin D intake
2) GI malabsorption (celiac, Crohn’s etc.)
B. Altered vitamin D metabolism
1) Liver disease – can’t form 25-OHD
2) ESRD – can’t form 1,25OHD
3) Anticonvulsants
C. Vitamin D resistance (rare)
-mutation in vitamin D receptor, etc.
II. PTH resistance – PTH can’t not act
A. Missense mutation in PTH (rare)

F. Hungry bone (after
parathyroidectomy)
E. Drugs – chelators (EDTA), foscarnet
citrate in blood transfusions
IV. Impaired ca release from skeleton
A. Drugs – bisphosphonates, denosumab
- typically only in the setting of
another abnormality such as vitamin d
deficiency, renal impairment,
unrecognized hypoparathyroidism or
very high doses of medication
Causes of Hypocalcemia – Low PTH
Low PTH (Hypoparathyrodisim) Destruction
• Post-surgical (thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy)
• Autoimmune destruction
• Parathyroid gland infiltration (mets, iron,
granuloma, amyloid etc.)
• Radiation
Parathyroid Hypofunction or PTH Hyposecretion
• Hypomagnesemia (<<1mg/dL)
alcoholism, cisplatin, some diuretics
• Hypermagnesemia (>>6 mg/dL)
• Cinacalcet
• CaSR activating mutation
Genetic/Congenital/Agenesis
• Abnormal parathyroid development
-DiGeorge’s syndrome, etc.
• Abnormal PTH synthesis
• Activing calcium sensing receptor mutation
Hypoparathyroidism

Treatment of Hypocalcemia
Who Requires IV Calcium?
• Symptomatic hypocalcemia
• Carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures
• Prolonged QTc interval regardless of symptoms
• Asymptomatic with an acute decrease in
corrected serum calcium to ≤ 7.5 mg/dl (1.9
mmol/L)
• Chronic hypocalcemia and unable to take oral
supplements (after complex surgery)
• Seizure history
Which Calcium Salt to Use?
Calcium gluconate
Calcium chloride
272 mg elemental calcium
90 mg elemental calcium
Calcinosis Cutis (tissue necrosis)
Kagen et al. Cutis. 2000;65(4):193-4.
Plaques on arm Calcification in dermis
Emergency Intravenous Calcium
Protocol
• Calcium gluconate
• 1-2 amps ( 90-180 mg elemental
calcium) 10% calcium gluconate
• No faster than over 15 minutes
• Faster admin  cardiac arrest
• Provides immediate relief of
symptoms
• Raises serum calcium for 2 hours
Calcium Infusion Protocol
To raise the serum calcium by 2-3 mg/dl:
10-15 mg/kg of calcium gluconate intravenously
(in 1 liter of D5W) over 6-8 hours
Example:
70 kg individual
15 mg/kg = 1050 mg calcium
Amps of 10% calcium gluconate= 1050 mg/90 mg/10 ml
= Approximately 11 amps
• 10% calcium gluconate (90 mg of
elemental calcium /10 ml)
• Put 11 g calcium gluconate (equals 990
mg elemental calcium) to D5W to make a
final volume of 1000 ml (~1 mg elemental
calcium/mL)
• Infuse at a rate of: 50 ml/hr (0.5 to 1.5
mg/kg of elemental calcium/hr.)
Calcium Infusion Protocol
Calcium Infusion Protocol
• Diluted in 5% dextrose to avoid vein irritation
• No bicarbonate or phosphate to avoid calcium
salts
• EKG monitoring as appropriate (especially if on
digoxin)
• If acidosis is present, correct serum calcium first
Other management guidelines
• In patients with hypomagnesemia,
hypocalcemia difficult to correct without
correcting hypomagnesemia FIRST!!
• When patients can take medication orally,
generally should be started on oral
calcium and vitamin D overlapping with
infusion
• Underlying etiology
• Oral calcium
• Oral Vitamin D

Management of Chronic Hypocalcemia
Vitamin D Metabolites
Supplements:
• Ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3)
• unhydroxylated
• Calcitriol 1,25(OH)2D
• Calcium from diet + supplements
• 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (rocaltrol)
– Can’t convert 25OHD  1,25OHD
• Parent D for other D metabolites and for nonskeletal effects
• Magnesium, if necessary
• Thiazides, if necessary, to control hypercalciuria
by increasing calcium reabsoprtion at distal tubule
Management of Hypoparathyroidism
• Keep asymptomatic of hypocalcemia
• Maintain calcium levels in low-normal reference range (8-
8.5 mg/dL)
• Avoid hypercalciuria (24-hour urine calcium <300 mg/day)
• Maintain serum phosphate level below 6 mg/dL
• Do not exceed the calcium-phosphate product of 55 mg2/dL2
• Avoid calcium deposition in tissues

Summary of Lecture
• The most common causes of hypercalcemia are
• PHPT
• Malignancy
• Diagnostic evaluation of hypercalcemia involves
distinguishing PTH-mediated from non-PTH mediated causes
• Management of severe hypercalcemia usually involves
hydration, calcitonin, IV bisphosphonates
• More common causes of hypocalcemia include renal failure,
vitamin D deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and pancreatitis
• Hypoparathyroidism is a rare cause of hypocalcemia
• The acute management of symptomatic hypocalcemia
involves giving IV calcium gluconate in the form of an infusion
• Hypomagnesemia needs correction first

Key Fracture Risk Factor: Age
“Imminent fracture risk:” a recent fracture is associated
with higher risk of future fracture than a remote fracture
Key Fracture Risk Factor:
Prior Fracture
Van Geel TACM et al Curr Osteoporosis Rep 2010; 8:118-122
Example: risk of major
osteoporotic fracture in 5
years after hip, shoulder or
clinical vertebral fracture
• The fracture risk is greatest
in first year following
baseline fracture
• As each year passes, the
risk of having another
fracture declines
Relative risk of second
hip fracture after first
hip fracture
• risk is very high in
first year (especially
in first 3-6 months)
• then declines and
plateaus, where risk
is much less than
initially

not decrease fractures
-but benefit seen in post hoc subgroup analysis of
women ≥ 60 yr and those who were adherent1
•Meta-analyses of large trials of calcium and vitamin D
show a small reduction in fracture risk (especially if a

Calcium and Vitamin D, Cont’d
• Vitamin D supplements of 2000 IU/d did not
reduce fracture risk in healthy adults1
• Calcium supplements in healthy adults do not

Reid et al Lancet 2022; 399:1080-92
• Osteoblasts
secrete RANK
ligand (RANKL),
which normally
binds to RANK
on the osteoclast
and activates it
• Denosumab is a
monoclonal
antibody that is a
decoy: it binds to
RANKL so that it
can’t bind to the
osteoclast
Denosumab Efficacy
• Reduces bone

to undetectable
within days
• BMD increases are
larger and continue

Denosumab
Denosumab Safety
• Administered SC q 6 months
• Correct D deficiency prior to avoid
hypocalcemia
• Can be used with eGFR < 30 mL/min, but with
increased risk of hypocalcemia
Denosumab Discontinuation Safety
• Rapid offset after discontinuation; rebound activation
of bone resorption: resorption markers “overshoot” at
~7 months after
•
“Osteomorphs” re-fuse to form active osteoclasts
• Multiple vertebral fractures occurred within 1 year of
discontinuation in 15%
• The risk is greater the longer someone has been on
denosumab
• Transition to zoledronate partially prevents this
• If denosumab was > 2 years, give zoledronate at 6
and 12 months
• Emphasize that adherence to 6 month regimen is
needed and with discontinuation transition to
zoledronate.

Anabolic First is Superior for
High Risk Patients
Kendler et al Lancet. 2018;391:230-240
Randomized active-controlled trial (VERO) in 1360 women
with ≥ 1 vertebral fracture
Fewer new radiographic vertebral fractures and clinical fractures with teriparatide vs risedronate at 12 and 24 months
Sequence of therapy matters: consider anabolic before
antiresorptive therapy for very high risk patients
• Superior to BPs for very high risk patients (4 RCTs)
• Fast acting: anabolic agents provide fast protection against
fractures (12-18 month for both vertebral and nonvertebral risk
reductions)
• Biologic plausibility: restore degraded bone microarchitecture
with anabolic agent first; then maintain or enhance bone mass
and strength with antiresorptive
• Attenuation of anabolic effect when given after antiresorptive,
especially marked with denosumab followed by teriparatide
(DATA-Switch)
Anabolic First for High Risk Patients
Romosozumab for one year followed by denosumab
for one year

Type 1 Diabetes
Natasha Leibel MD
Director, Pediatric Diabetes Program
Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center
Columbia University Medical Center
No conflicts of interest
Learning objectives
• Recognize the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes (T1D)
• Understand that insulin treatment can never be eliminated in a
person with type 1 diabetes
• Understand that type 1 diabetes is a state of insulin deficiency caused
by autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing beta cells in the
pancreas
Patient Presentation
• Previously healthy 10 year old girl
• 1 month history of:
increased thirst (polydipsia)
increased hunger (polyphagia)
increased urination (polyuria)
• Has started wetting the bed (nocturnal enuresis)
• Despite eating constantly is losing weight
• Very irritable
• Develops emesis and lethargy
• Parents take her to the pediatrician
Patient Presentation
• Urine dip - glucose and ketones in the urine
• Sent to the emergency room
• Physical Exam: tired, sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, pulse is
120 bpm, capillary refill is 3 seconds, extremities feel cool
• She has Kussmaul respirations – deep labored breathing, a form of
hyperventilation
• Her breath smells fruity like acetone (nail polish remover)
• In ED has a venous blood gas: blood pH is 7.0 (normal is 7.4) and the
blood sugar is 700 mg/dL (normal is 70-120mg/dL)
• Hemoglobin A1c is 14% (normal is under 6%)
Patient Presentation
• Family is told that their daughter has type 1 diabetes and will need to
take insulin injections every day for life
• She is currently in diabetic ketoacidosis
• She is started on IV hydration
• Insulin drip (continuous insulin intravenously)
• Monitored in the ICU until stable
• Once stable will stay in hospital so that family can learn how to check
blood sugars and give insulin injections, proper diet and insulin
dosing, how to treat low and high blood sugars
Patient Presentation
• Parents are shocked – no one in the family has this
• Mother has Hashimoto thyroiditis and father has a sibling with celiac
disease
• “Could this be something else?” NO
• “Will this ever go away?” NO
• “My child is going to need shots every day?” YES
• “How many?” USUALLY 5 OR 6
• “Can she still eat cake?” YES
• “Can she drink in college?” YES
Emotional toll of the diagnosis is immense
• Anger
• Grief
• Denial
• Mourning the loss of the “perfect” child or life
• Guilt
• Must provide reassurance that this is no one’s fault - nothing could
have been done to prevent it
What does insulin do and what happens when you
do not make any?
Energy homeostasis is complex: interplay of the
digestive system/brain/liver/muscle/adipose tissue
• Insulin is released from the beta
cell of the pancreas when
carbohydrates are abundant
• Stimulates the conversion of
glucose to proteins lipids and
glycogen
• Majority of insulin stimulated
uptake occurs in the muscle cell
• This is the major cellular
mechanism controls glucose
released from food ingestion
Nature 2012
Insulin and GLUT4 Glucose Transporter
• Once at the muscle cell insulin
brings Glut4 to the cell surface
• Allows entry of glucose
• Glut4 plays a key role in
regulating whole body glucose
homeostasis




Diabetes Mellitus
• Not a single disease entity
• Metabolic disorders that all have hyperglycemia as the defining
characteristic
• Blood glucose levels should be maintained in a very narrow range
(Fasting 70-99mg/dl, post-prandial below 140mg/dL)
• Diabetes is diagnosed when the blood sugar rises above the set
criteria
Diagnostic Criteria for Diagnosing Diabetes Standards of Medical
Care in Diabetes—2018
FPG ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*
OR
2-h PG ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO,
using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.*
OR
A1C ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP
certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.*
OR
In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose
≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
Diabetes Care 2018 Jan; 41(Supplement 1)
Diabetes Mellitus: Type 1 and Type 2
➢The majority of diabetes cases fall into 2 categories:
➢Type 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune process that destroys
the islets leaving inadequate levels of insulin production (10% of
cases).
➢Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of peripheral resistance
to insulin action and inadequate insulin secretion by the beta call.
This form of diabetes is highly linked to obesity and accounts for
about 90% of cases of diabetes.
Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes: Standards of
Medical Care in Diabetes—2018
Diabetes can be classified into the following general categories:
1.Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin
deficiency)
2.Type 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of β-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background
of insulin resistance)
3.Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of
pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation)
4.Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as
neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine
pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as
with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)
Diabetes Care 2018 Jan; 41(Supplement 1)
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)
• A chronic disease with no cure
• Due to the autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing beta
cell in the pancreas
• Requires constant DAILY (hourly) vigilance checking blood sugars and
taking multiple daily insulin injections
• Severe short term consequences such as DKA from a lack of insulin,
or life threatening hypoglycemia from too much insulin
• Severe long term consequences if not treated properly, including
blindness, renal failure, heart disease and amputation
What happened to people with diabetes
before the discovery of insulin in 1921?
History of Diabetes
The word diabetes is Greek meaning siphon or
passing through. Mellitus means sweet “honeyed”
1500s BC: described on Ebers Papyrus as frequent
urination and emaciation
100 AD: Greek physician Aretaeus wrote: life for a
person with diabetes was “short, disgusting and
painful, a melting down of the flesh and limbs into
urine.” Treatment was jelly of viper’s flesh, red
coral, sweet almonds, blind nettles
Until 1921 treatment was keto diet and exercise,
uniformly fatal
1921 Banting and Best, University of Toronto
Discovery of Insulin 1921
• By 1922 being used in humans
• Awarded the Nobel Prize
• One of the most important discoveries in medicine
EM: Admitted to Columbia Presbyterian
November 1922

EM, July 1923
Type 1 Diabetes: Incidence and Prevalence
• Probably around 3 million people in the US with T1DM
• Peak presentation at 5-7 years and again at time of puberty
• Higher risk if in a first degree family member (1:300 to 1:20)
• Affects children as young as 9 months and adults
• Significant upward trend in T1D annual increase of 1.4%,
increasing more in males (M:F 1.32)
• In children highest increase in East South Central US and
Mountain regions
Why do people get type 1 diabetes?
“T1D develops as a consequence of a combination of genetic
predisposition, largely unknown environmentalfactors, and
stochastic events.” (Eisenbarth, Nature 2010)
Its incidence is increasing, especially in children under 5 years
of age.
Thought at one time to be a “childhood” disease it absolutely
can be diagnosed into late adulthood.
Pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes
• Autoimmune disease: INTERPLAY OF GENETICS AND THE
ENVIRONMENT
• The underlying immune abnormality in T1D is a failure of selftolerance
• Beta cell destruction in the pancreas is caused by immune effectors
reacting against endogenous beta cell antigens
Natural History of Type 1 Diabetes: Eisenbarth Model
Genetic Predisposition: Allelic Variants Associated with T1D Odds ratio
Concannon, NEJM 2009
HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes provide the
greatest contribution to genetic susceptibility for T1D:
these genes encode for proteins that play a critical role in
the immune system (link to other autoimmune conditions
such as thyroid disease and celiac)
Certain HLA haplotypes are particularly associated with
a higher risk of developing diabetes: but by no means
predictive
Over 40 loci are thought to confer
susceptibility to T1D: most of the loci associated
with risk of T1D are thought to involve immune
responses
Genetic susceptibility due to HLA haplotype seems to
be playing less of role in the development of T1D now
than in prior decades
Genetic Predisposition
• Genetic influence contributes to aberrant immune response including
the development and maintenance of tolerance
• Autoreactive T cells appear to play a dominant role in disease
initiation and progression
• Islets of patients with diabetes have a predominance of CD8+ T cells,
followed by macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and B lymphocytes – appear
inflammed “insulitis”
• Does pancreatic size play a role? May be an underappreciated risk for
development of T1D either with or without corresponding insulitis, ie
multiple mechanisms for the development of T1D
Environment: What triggers the destruction?
• ? Viruses – may induce autoimmunity by causing islet cell
injury/inflammation releasing beta cell antigens and activating
autoreactive T cells
• ? Nutrition (early cow’s milk introduction)
• ? Hygiene hypothesis (reduced stimulation of the immune system in
our cleaner society)
• Ongoing large prospective multicenter screening programs will
hopefully elucidate this further

Autoimmunity
• The autoimmunity in TIDM is identified by the presence of
autoantibodies to islet and/or beta cell antigens
• We can measure these in the blood
• Present in 80% of patients newly diagnosed (in contrast to
0.5% of general population)
• GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase)
• ICA (islet cell antibodies)
• IAA (insulin autoantibodies)
• Zinc Transporter
• We can measure these antibodies in those at high risk, ie
siblings – possibly intervene before overt onset of diabetes

T1D Prevention in High Risk Patients (ages 12-22)
Back to our patient….Classic Presentation
• Previously healthy school aged child
• Polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia
• Losing weight
• Very tired
• Waking up at night to urinate or wetting the bed
• No family history of T1DM
• But tightly linked with other autoimmune diseases either in the
patient or family: thyroid disease, celiac disease, vitiligo, alopecia
How are we going to treat this patient?
There is only one treatment
• Insulin
• Insulin
• Insulin
• Cannot withhold insulin from a patient with type 1 diabetes
• TIDM can never be treated with lifestyle or diet modifications, or oral
medications like in T2DM
• Goal is to have as “tight” blood sugar control as possible, meaning
keep the blood sugars as close to the normal range (80-180mg/dl)
• This prevents the once unavoidable long term complications
T1DM: Historical Perspective On Course of Disease
⚫ Until 1922 -- T1D as Fatal Illness
⚫ Then First Use of Insulin
⚫ 1923 to 1995 -- T1D as Devastating Illness
⚫ Era of (inevitable) Diabetes Complications: blindness, renal failure, amputation, heart
disease
⚫ 1995 to present -- T1D as Chronic Condition
⚫ Era of Pharmacology, Technology

Diabetes Control and Complications Trial:
DCCT, NEJM, 1995
Multiple daily injections (4 or
more) versus conventional
therapy (2 injections per day).
MDI had a significant impact on
A1c control and complications.

Insulin Action
Insulin Type and Action Times
Basal/Bolus Insulin Concept
• Rapid Acting = BOLUS insulin,
follows food digestion and
absorption
• Prolonged Acting = BASAL
insulin, steady state of release
over 24 hours
Basal/Bolus Insulin Concept: Mimics
Physiologic Insulin Release
• Basal Insulin
-Suppresses glucose production by the liver between meals and
overnight
-Taken even if not eating at all (ALWAYS need insulin)
-Dose set by doctor, same day to day
• Bolus Insulin
- Given 15 minutes before eating
-Limits hyperglycemia after meals
-Must be given for all foods that contain carbohydrates
-dose is calculated based on what the blood sugar is and how much
carbohydrate is going to be consumed

Limitations of Current Insulin Therapy
• Insulin when injected subcutaneously is not rapid enough to match
the spike in blood sugar from food, in particular very high
carbohydrate food
• Once insulin is injected there is no way to “turn it off” – risk of
hypoglycemia if mismatched dosing (cannot change your mind about
what you are eating if you take insulin)
• Low blood sugars remain a daily problem – can cause anxiety
• All forms of administration are inherently painful
• Very expensive
Food Can Be Difficult – Especially for Children
Both have 26 grams of carbohydrate so would get the same amount
of insulin but the blood sugar response will be completely different
Day in the Life of Someone with Diabetes:
Checking blood sugars and taking insulin
Checking blood sugars
• Before meals
• Before bed
• Before and after exercise
• Before driving
• Symptoms of hypoglycemia
• Some parents check their
child’s blood sugar over 15
times per day
• Successful management
requires at least 6-10 times per
day
Insulin Delivery: Injections
Technology
Pumping Insulin
• Revolutionized diabetes management
• Precise and personalized
• Micro doses - as small as 0.025 units (syringe or pen
lowest dose is 0.5 units)
• Greater lifestyle flexibility/spontaneity
• Less pain
Insulin Pumps
Insulin Pumps
• Use rapid acting insulin analogues, replaces need for long acting
insulin
• Delivers basal insulin automatically every hour, can set different basal
rates throughout the day
• Enter the blood sugar and the amount of carbohydrate to be eaten
and the insulin dose is calculated – given as a bolus
• Pumps are worn 24 hours a day (can disconnect for brief periods)
• Changed every 2-3 days
• High risk of DKA if stop working

Continuous Glucose Monitor: Dexcom System
Interpreting CGM Data and Arrows



Downside to all of this data….
• Data overload
• Excessive nagging by parents
• “Rage bolusing”
• “Sugar surfing”
• Burn out
• Embarrassing alarms
Why is T1D so hard to manage?
Variability of Insulin Requirements
Overnight variability as high as 300% from baseline, daytime up to 200% (Ruan 2016
Diabetes Care)
Factors in Blood Sugar Control
• Food: what and when
• Hormones: growth/puberty/cortisol
• Excitement/Anxiety
• Activity
• Sleep
• Altitude
• Illness
The “Artificial Pancreas”
• Hybrid closed loop system
• Combines glucose sensor with insulin pump
• A control algorithm directs insulin delivery to increase or decrease
depending on the blood sugar
• Suspends insulin delivery when a low threshold is reached
• Minimize hypo and hyperglycemic excursions
A1c significantly improved

T1DM TODAY
• People with type 1 diabetes can lead healthy and normal lives
• Chronic diabetes complications are largely preventable
• But…Type 1 diabetes management remains challenging, stressful,
expensive and time-consuming
• Huge psychological toll on the patient and family

Far too few patients achieve A1c goals
T1D Exchange 2016-2018
USE OF A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR HELPS BRING THE A1c CLOSER TO 7% THAN
ANY OTHER INTERVENTION
What is on the horizon?
What took 100 years will now take 10 years to achieve
iLet: Bionic Pancreas
• User wears a Dexcom CGM and the iLet pump
• Small studies showed significant improvement in mean glucose and
less hypoglycemia
• Initial large scale trial now in US (NBDC is a site)

STATEMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AND HUMILITY:
Learning Objectives
• Identify risk factors for the development of Type 2
Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
• Describe the pathophysiology of T2DM
• Describe effective interventions to prevent development
of T2DM
Epidemiology
• Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by
elevated levels of blood glucose
• Over 90% of diabetes mellitus cases are secondary to Type 2
Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
• 463 million adults are currently living with diabetes with projected
prevalence of 700 million adults by 2045
• Patients with T2DM have a 15% increased risk of all-cause mortality
• 7th leading cause of death in the US
Healthcare Costs
• Annual $327 billion total medical costs and lost work and wages for people with
diagnosed diabetes
• Risk of early death for adults with diabetes is 60% higher than for adults without
diabetes
• Medical costs for people with diabetes are more than 2x high as for people
without diabetes
• People who have diabetes are at higher risk of serious health complications:
• blindness
• kidney failure
• heart disease
• stroke
• loss of toes, feet, or legs

• Obesity
• Physical Inactivity

Who to Screen for Type 2 Diabetes?
1) Patients who are overweight or obese with one or more risk factor:
• First degree family member with diabetes
• High risk groups: HTN, HDL<35 mg/dl, TG >250 mg/dL, PCOS, Physical inactivity, high risk race/ethnicity (African American, Latino, Native American,
Asian American, Pacific Islander)
2) Patients with pre-diabetes - yearly
3) Women with a hx of gestational diabetes – at least every 3 years
4) Patients on antiretroviral therapy for HIV – yearly
5) All other patients should be screened starting at age 35
• If results are normal, repeat testing every 3 years or sooner based on risk
ADA. The Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2022
Diagnostic Criteria
Any of the following would confirm a diagnosis of diabetes:
• Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dl
• Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hour
• 2- hour prandial glucose (PG) ≥200 mg/dl during a 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
• Hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5%
• Patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis with a random
plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl
*Of note, diagnosis requires 2 abnormal test results unless there is a clear clinical
diagnosis with a random glucose ≥200 mg/dl

Diagnostic Pearls
• Compared with fasting plasma glucose and A1C, the 2-h PG value
diagnoses more people with prediabetes and diabetes
• If there is a discordance between A1c and glucose values, the FPG and 2-
hour PG are more accurate
• A1c may be less reliable in patients with hemoglobinopathies:
• Sickle Cell Disease
• Pregnancy
• Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
• HIV
• Hemodialysis
• Recent blood loss or transfusion
• Erythropoietin therapy
Genetics
• Monogenic: single gene variant is necessary and sufficient to
cause disease
• Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
• Inherited or sporadic
• Prevalence 1-4%
• Family history of diabetes in multiple successive generations
• Polygenic: more than 100 genes linked to T2DM
• 39% of patients with T2DM have at least one parent with the disease
• Among monozygotic twins, if one twin is affected the unaffected twin
has a 90% chance of eventually developing diabetes
Pathophysiology
Pathogenesis is multifactorial, a combination of genetic and
environmental conditions that lead to:
1) Defective insulin secretion from β-cell dysfunction leading to a
relative hypoinsulinemia
2) Insulin resistance
3) Increased glucose production by the liver
β-cells of the pancreas are
responsible for insulin production
High circulating glucose levels
trigger uptake of glucose through
GLUT2 receptor à Triggers
closing of ATP-dependent
potassium channels and release
of calcium into the cell à Rise in
calcium triggers the synthesis and
exocytosis of insulin
Galicia-Garcia et al. “Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.” Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21(17), 6275;
β-cell dysfunction can occur from
an excessive nutritional state like
obesity
Hyperglycemia à increases
reactive oxygen species à islet
cell inflammation and β-cell death
Elevated Free Fatty Acids à
endoplasmic reticulum stress
In mouse models, mice on a highfat diet developed impaired
GLUT-2 receptors impairing
glucose transport into the cell and
decreasing insulin release

β-cell Mass Influences DM
β-cell Mass Influences DM
Insulin Resistance
• Insulin resistance is defined as a
decrease in the metabolic response of
cells to insulin
• Insulin binds to the insulin receptor
(adipose and skeletal cells), a tyrosine- kinase à leads to translocation of GLUT-4
receptors à uptake of glucose into the cell
• Genetic mutations of the insulin receptor
or GLUT4 can lead to IR
• Obesity can lead to chronic inflammation
à decrease GLUT4 release
• Exercise increases blood flow to skeletal
muscle increasing glucose utilization
Galicia-Garcia et al. “Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.” Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21(17), 6275;
Conditions that Induce Insulin Resistance
• Gestational Diabetes
• Medications
• Glucocorticoids
• Immunosuppressive agents
• Statins
• Stressors
• Infection
• Surgery
Gestational Diabetes
• Defined as any pregnant person who develops diabetes during pregnancy
• Screen high risk individuals in first trimester for pre-gestation diabetes
• Routine screening 24-28 week gestation with OGTT
• 2nd and 3rd trimester à increase release of GH, placental Lactogen, Prolactin, progesterone, Corticotropin-releasing hormone -> increase IR
• Increases risk for preeclampsia, macrosomia (>8 lbs 13 oz), birth trauma, operative delivery, perinatal mortality, neonatal respiratory problems and
metabolic complications
• 50% of people with gestational diabetes will develop T2DM
Conditions that Induce Insulin Resistance
• Gestational Diabetes
• Medications
• Glucocorticoids
• Immunosuppressive agents
• Statins
• Stressors
• Infection
• Surgery
Acanthosis Nigricans
Hepatic Implications of DM
• Insulin helps to regulate glucose production and utilization in the
liver
• In a proinflammatory state combined with oxidative stress:
• Impaired glycogen synthesis
• Failure to suppress gluconeogenesis
• Synthesis of pro-inflammatory proteins-> CRP
• Enhanced lipogenesis
• Inappropriate levels of glucagon in T2DM may also contribute to
increased gluconeogenesis

Role of the Gut Microbiome in T2DM
• Growing evidence that gut microbiome is a major mediator of the effects of diet
and environment
• Microbiome may contribute to obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome
• Microbiome have effects on barrier function, modification of bile, and education of
the immune system à can lead to release of bacterial proteins and endotoxins à
immune activation à insulin resistance
• Several studies have indicated that, compared with healthy participants, patients with type 2 diabetes have a lower overall diversity of gut microbiome composition
• Currently, use of pro and prebiotics and other new techniques such as fecal
microbiota transplant, or even antibiotic therapy, are being investigated

Endocrinopathies and Hyperglycemia
• Hyperthyroidism
• Acromegaly
• Hypercortisolism – Cushing’s
• Pheochromocytoma
• Glucagonoma
• Somatostatin-secreting tumors
Necrolytic Migratory Erythema
Diseases of the Exocrine Pancreas
• Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes
• Inherited disorder
• Overproduction of mucous in the pancreas à β-cell destruction
• Presentation combination between Type 1 DM and Type 2 DM
• Treat only with insulin
• Hemochromatosis
• Iron overload à β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance
• Presentation varies
• Chronic Pancreatitis
• Glucose intolerance
• Diabetes in late stages of the disease
Pancreatic Cancer
• 3rd in all cancer related deaths, diabetes is a risk factor
• Often diagnosed late stage, only 15-20% of tumors can be resected
• Up to 80% of pancreatic cancer patients present with either new- onset T2DM or impaired glucose tolerance at the time of diagnosis
• Pancreatic tumor can cause beta-cell destruction and or dysfunction
• Consider screening patients aged >50, rapid weight loss, fast
progression of hyperglycemia with CT Abdomen/Pelvis
Prevention
• Annual monitoring for the development of T2DM in those with pre-diabetes
• Lifestyle Behavior Change
• The Diabetes Prevention Program
• Maintain 7% loss of initial body weight and increase moderate-intensity
physical activity (such as brisk walking) to at least 150 min/week.
• 58% reduction in the incidence rate of diabetes
• Metformin therapy should be considered in those with pre-diabetes,
especially those with BMI ≥35 kg/m2, aged <60 years, and people with
prior gestational diabetes mellitus
• 31% reduction in the development of diabetes
• Bariatric Surgery
• 78% reduction in the development of T2DM
Take Home Points
• The etiology of Type 2 Diabetes is multifactorial with a
combination of genetic susceptibility with influence of the
environment on clinical penetrance
• Genetic susceptibility is largely influenced by beta-cell function
and viability
• Insulin resistance, resulting from obesity or other underlying
pathologies causes beta cell stress and further beta-cell failure
• Lifestyle interventions can reduce incidence rate of diabetes

Diabetes Mellitus: DKA, HHS, Hypoglycemia
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
• An acute metabolic complication of diabetes
characterized by an absolute or relative insulin
deficiency.
• It is most commonly seen in patients with Type 1 DM
but can also occur in patients with Type 2.
• It is characterized by the biochemical triad of:
• Hyperglycemia- blood glucose >250 mg/dL
• Ketonemia- positive serum ketones or urine ketones
• Anion gap metabolic acidosis – anion gap > 10, pH
<7.3, serum bicarbonate <18 mEq/L

Adapted from Umpierrez and Korytkowski , Nat Rev Endocrinol 2016
Pathophysiology of DKA
• Insulin Deficiency: Leads to
hyperglycemia and a perceived
fasting state indirectly activating
lipolysis and ketogenesis
• Counter-regulatory hormones:
Promote glycogenolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis ->
hyperglycemia and ketogenesis
• Dehydration: Hyperglycemiainduced osmotic diuresis leads to
electrolyte loss, decreased
glomerular filtration and worsens
hyperglycemia
Ketone Production
Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State
(HHS)
• HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and
dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis.
• Clinical presentation commonly resembles the signs and symptoms seen
in DKA.
• DKA is typically more acute, HHS may have symptoms develop
over days to weeks.
• Laboratory findings:
• Hyperglycemia: typically above 600mg/dl
• Hyperosmolarity: serum osmolality > 320 mOsmol/kg
• Serum pH >7.3
• Absent to mildly elevated ketones
• Pathophysiology:
• Insulin Deficiency
• Upregulation of counter-regulatory hormones
• Inhibition to limited ketone production
• Dehydration

Goals of Treatment
1) Restore intravascular volume with IVF
2) Correct electrolyte abnormalities
3) Correct hyperglycemia and acidosis with insulin
therapy
4) Identify and treat any precipitating factors
5) Provide patient and family education to prevent future
recurrent episodes of DKA/HHS
Hypoglycemia
• Clinical hypoglycemia is a plasma (or serum) glucose
concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs,
including impairment of brain function.
• Lower limit of normal fasting glucose is 70 mg/dL but the onset of
symptoms normally occur as levels fall <55 mg/dl
• Can be caused by too much insulin or oral anti-hyperglycemic
agents, too little food, or excessive physical activity
• Hypoglycemia is confirmed by fulfillment of Whipple’s Triad
1. Symptoms, signs or both consistent with hypoglycemia
2. Low plasma glucose concentration
3. Resolution of symptoms/signs after the plasma glucose is
raised
Physiology of Hypoglycemia
• The brain cannot synthesize glucose -> dependent on
continuous glucose supply from the circulation
• There are counterregulatory systems in place to prevent or
rapidly correct hypoglycemia
• Decrease insulin secretion
• Increase glucagon secretion ->glycogen breakdown in the liver
• Increase epinephrine secretion ->increases hepatic glucose production
• Increase cortisol and GH secretion -> enhance hepatic glucose
production, increase insulin resistance
• Symptoms and signs
• Autonomic Symptoms (adrenergic): palpitations, tremor, anxiety
• Neuroglycopenic symptoms (glucose deprivation in the brain):
dizziness, confusion, weakness
Treatment of Hypoglycemia
• Correct hypoglycemia with 15 grams of fast acting concentrated
carbohydrate such as:
• Three to four commercially prepared glucose tablets or 15g of dextrose
gel
• 4 to 6 oz of fruit juice or regular soda
• 6-10 life savers or other hard candies
• 2-3 teaspoons of sugar or honey
• For patients who are unconscious and cannot swallow, an
injection of glucagon 1mg can be administered subcutaneously
or intramuscularly
• For patients in the hospital, may be treated with 25 to 50ml 50%
dextrose in water administered intravenously

• Glucose is normally
phosphorylated by
the enzyme
hexokinase
• Hyperglycemia
saturates hexokinase
->polyol pathway
• The polyol pathway
leads to reduced
levels of NADPH and
NAD+ -> reduce
glutathione synthesis
and increase risk for
oxidative stress and
damage
Advanced Glycosylation End Products
(AGEs)
• Complications of diabetes have
been described as an accelerated
aging process
• In aging, proteins are altered by
sugars leading to tissue browning
• Hyperglycemia can lead to glucose
combining with proteins ->
advanced glycosylation end
products (AGEs)
• AGE’s can
• Affect gene transcription
• Cause cellular dysfunction
• Increase production of
cytokines and growth factors -

Risk Factors for
Progression of Retinopathy
• Poor glycemic control
• Longer duration of DM
• Baseline severity
• Pre-pubertal onset of Type 1 DM
• Pregnancy
• Sudden improvement in glucose control

including pain, itch, and temperature discrimination
Pain:
• Dysesthesias: burning pain
• Hyperalgesia: exaggerated pain
• Allodynia: pain caused by a painless contact
• Paresthesia: pins and needles
• Decreased thermal discrimination
• Autonomic small fibers also carry messages that
control our internal organs
• Assess function by testing temperature with a hot and
cold test and sensation with a pinprick exam
Large Fiber Sensory Neuropathy
• Thicker fibers covered in myelin
• Loss of protective sensation
• Loss of sense of position of different parts of the body
(proprioception)
• Poor balance
• Decreased vibration sense
• Decreased ankle reflex
• May lead to callus, foot ulcers, Charcot foot,
amputations
Tuning Fork (128 Hz)
Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament
Autonomic Neuropathy
•Affects the sympathetic
and parasympathetic
system
•Responsible for a
significant proportion of
the morbidity and
mortality associated
with DM
Autonomic Neuropathy
Cardiovascular: impaired autonomic control of the
cardiovascular system
• Clinically associated with:
• Resting tachycardia: ê parasympathetic tone
• Orthostatic hypotension: baroreflex failure
• Silent ischemia
• Sudden death: ventricular arrhythmias
Autonomic Neuropathy
Gastrointestinal
-Gastroparesis: delayed gastric emptying
-GERD
-Enteropathy: diarrhea
-Colonic hypomotility: constipation
Nephropathy
Nephropathy
Prevalence
• T1DM 25-40%
• T2DM 5-40%
Leading cause of End Stage Renal Disease
• 4-17% of DM develop ESRD @ ~20-30 y
• 40% of patients on dialysis have Diabetic
nephropathy
.
Krolewski, NEJM, 1987
Duration of DM in years
Risk Factors for Diabetic
Nephropathy
•Poor glycemic control
•Genetic susceptibility
•HTN
•Smoking
•Dyslipidemia
Clinical Progression Model of DN
• Diabetic nephropathy can be monitored by measuring urine
protein to characterize the degree of progression
Early phase: Hyperfiltration
• ↑ GFR: from afferent arteriole dilation>>>efferent arteriole dilation
• ↑ Glomerular Pressure
• Thickened GBM and mesangial expansion
Microalbuminuria: u albumin 30-300 mg/24h
• Dysfunction of the Glomerular Filtration Barrier: podocyte and
endothelial damage
• Damage may be reversible
Macroalbuminuria: u albumin >300 mg/24h
• êGFR
• ↑ BP
End Stage Renal Disease
• Uremia
• HD/renal transplant
Prevention of Renal Disease
• Diabetic nephropathy can be prevented and its
progression can also be slowed
• Yearly screening for urine albumin excretion rate
• Lifestyle Modification: smoking cessation, exercise,
weight loss
• Tight glucose control:
• Consider SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in
Type 2 DM
• Hypertension control
• <140/90 (low CV Risk)
• <130/80 (high CV Risk, >15%)
• ACE Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for
blood pressure control or when macroalbuminuria is
present
MACROVASCULAR
COMPLICATIONS
Risk of CVD is 2-4x
compared with nondiabetic individuals.
Coronary Heart
disease: Angina,
MI
Peripheral vascular
disease:
Claudication,
ulceration,
gangrene
Cerebral circulation:
TIA, stroke
Macrovascular Complications in Diabetes Mellitus:
CVD
CVD Prevalence in Patients
with Diabetes 1997-2003
Cutaneous Complications of Diabetes
• Skin disorders will be present in 79.2% of people with
diabetes
• Cutaneous disease can appear as the first sign of
diabetes or may develop at any time in the course of
the disease
• The most common skin manifestations were cutaneous
infections (47.5%), xerosis (26.4%), and inflammatory
skin diseases (20.7%)
Duff, Michelle et al. “Cutaneous manifestations of diabetes mellitus.” Clinical diabetes : a publication of the American Diabetes
Association vol. 33,1 (2015): 40-8.

Berlin, Heidelberg.
Insulin Lipodystrophy
• Lipodystrophy refers to a
localized reaction, in the
formation of either
lipoatrophy (loss of
subcutaneous fat) or
lipohypertrophy
(development of fibrofatty
tissue), occurring at the
site of insulin injections
• If insulin is injected into
scarred areas, absorption
may be delayed
Hedges, Karen, and Ruth Poole. “Vitiligo and Lipohypertrophy Surrounding Insulin Injection Sites in a Patient with Type 1
Diabetes.” Practical Diabetes, vol. 33, no. 1, 2016.
Preventing Complications: Strict Glycemic
Control
• Large clinical trials have shown that tight glycemic control reduces
the microvascular complications in patients with type 1 and type 2
DM
• The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)-
multicenter randomized control trial of 1500 patients with Type 1
DM randomized to receive treatment for tight blood glucose
control vs. usual control
• Intensive control reduced risk of
• Retinopathy onset by 76%
• Nephropathy by 54%
• Neuropathy by 60%
• Increased risk for severe hypoglycemia
• In a 30 year follow-up study (EDIC), there was a 32% decrease
in adverse cardiovascular outcomes
Preventing Complications: Strict
Glycemic Control
• The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS)
• Similarly assessed the benefits of tight glycemic
control compared to usual control, but in patients
with Type 2 DM in over 5000 patients in the UK
• There was a statistically significant 25% decrease
in microvascular outcomes in the intensive group
compared to the conventional group
• In follow-up, there was no statistically significant
decrease in cardiovascular outcomes
• For macrovascular disease, control of CV risk factors
(ie: smoking, HTN, lipids) is most beneficial

What is Obesity?
• Obesity is a chronic condition characterized by excess body fat, which
increases the risk for adverse metabolic, biomechanical and
psychosocial health consequences.
• Causes of obesity: complex interplay between multiple contributing
factors including genetic/epigenetic, metabolic, medical conditions,
environmental, medications and behavioral factors
• Ongoing management is required to maintain a weight loss long-term.
• CDC prevalence data for adults in U.S.1
:
❖ Overweight or higher weight class: 73.1%
❖ Obesity: 42.4%

Why is it so hard to lose and especially maintain a weight loss?
Obesogenic environment:
●Promotes overconsumption (portion sizes, processed foods)
●Discourages volitional physical activity (technology)
Neuronal mechanisms that reward us when we eat fatty, starchy or
sugary food
Counterregulatory adaptations to weight loss to protect us from

Obesity is a complex disease w/ variety of contributing factors
Screen using a body mass index and WC
Assess for reversible causes and comorbidities
Therapies:
➢ Lifestyle- cornerstone of all therapies
➢ Medications- more selective, often combinations to target different
hormonal pathways
-counteract counter-regulatory mechs which -> wt regain
-lower doses of meds -> improved efficacy & safety
➢ Medical Devices/Endoscopic- new options to fill void b/t lifestyle and
surgery, moderate efficacy/risk
➢ Surgery- long-term wt loss and highest rates for remission of metabolic
comorbidities like diabetes
➢ Multifaceted solutions required -> need to think outside the box
➢ remember that 5-10% weight loss can significantly decrease CV risk
factors (BP, lipids, glucose), improve mobility, decrease pill burden

Objectives
•Assessment of Obesity
•Bias-Free Environment
•Initiating a Lifestyle Intervention
•Basic Macronutrient Information
•Dietary Plans for Weight Loss

What is Obesity?
•Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by excess body fat,
which increases the risk for adverse metabolic, biomechanical
and psychosocial health consequences.
•Its causes are usually multifactorial and can be complex.
•Contributing factors include: genetic/epigenetic, metabolic,
medical conditions, environmental, medications and behavioral
factors
•Ongoing management is required to maintain a weight loss
long-term.

How Is Obesity Assessed?
•Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI)*:
BMI= weight (kg)
height (m2
)
•Measure Waist Circumference (WC)
Goal*: <35” for females, <40” for males
•Weight-related Comorbidities
*BMI & WC goals may vary by ethnicity
Jensen MD et al. (2013) AHA/ACC/TOS Obesity Guidelines
Addressing Obesity/Readiness to Change
●Appropriate timing: not during urgent visit
●Ask: if ok to discuss, if want to lose weight, their ideas
●Stages of change: Pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action &
maintenance; stages are cyclical and dynamic.
●Meet patient where they are
●Brief discussion -> 5% weight loss at 1 yr more likely
●LookAHEAD Study: ILI w/5-10% weight loss improves:
Blood pressure
Blood glucose
Triglycerides
●Diabetes Prevention Program: ILI can reduce the progression from
prediabetes to diabetes over 4 years by 58% c/w placebo, with only modest
wt loss (5.6kg)

ILI= Intensive lifestyle intervention
In Healthcare:
●Medical students/clinicians use terms such as “lazy, noncompliant,
stupid” to describe patients with obesity
●Care of patients with obesity vs. normal weight peers:
Doctors spend less time in the room
Doctors refer for routine screenings at lower rates
Effects on patients with obesity:
●Depression
●Decreased physical activity
●Decreased patient engagement and follow-up
Steps for providers/educators:
●Do not attribute all problems to excess weight
●Be aware that weight stigma is not an effective motivator for patients
●Be aware of example we set for other medical trainees:
● Explicit weight bias significantly increased in year 4 of medical school vs yr 1
Weight Bias/Stigma

Lifestyle Intervention
•Cornerstone of all weight loss therapies
•BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2
•Components:
Dietary
Physical Activity
Behavior therapy
Treatment for Obesity cont.
It’s advised that high intensity treatment last ≥ 6 months in
a comprehensive lifestyle program provided in
individual or group sessions by trained interventionists
In order to lose weight (reduce fat stores), individuals must
create an energy imbalance. Changes include:
Energy intake
Energy output
Efficiency of energy use
Combination of all
Although weight loss can occur solely through diet or
exercise, a combination is considered more successful for
weight loss and weight loss maintenance
Basic Food Facts
Fat=9 kcal/gram
ETOH=7 kcal/gram
Protein= 4 kcal/gram
Carb/Sugar/Starch= 4 kcal/gram
Sugar Alcohols= ~2.6 kcal/gram
Artificial Sweeteners= ~1 kcal/gram
Carbohydrates
Preferred source of fuel for the brain and muscles; spares protein.
Examples: starches, starchy vegetables, beans/legumes, fruit, milk, and
yogurt products.
Serving sizes: ⅓ cup cooked rice, ¼ bagel, ½ cup starchy veg
It’s reasonable to have ½ -1 cup starch per meal.
White and whole wheat: similar calories, but whole wheat products
have more fiber and nutrients.
Milk (cow’s)- all varieties contain the same amount of carbs, protein and
calcium. Fat content changes the total calories.

Lifestyle:
-Dietary Intervention
-Physical Activity
-Behavior Therapy
Lifestyle: Dietary Plans for Weight Loss
-Create a caloric deficit
-Adherence determines weight loss, not the type of diet
-Options by preferences/availability of items:
●Prior diet
●Diet to treat comorbidities:
DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension): decr BP
Mediterranean Diet: decr LDL-C and CV mortality
Low Glycemic Index diet: prediabetes or diabetes
●Calorie counting:
1 lb ≈ 3,500 kcals; to lose 1 lb/wk: 500-750 kcal/d deficit
Quick calorie estimate:
• Current weight < 250 lbs: 1200-1500 kcal/day
• Current weight > 250 lbs: 1500-1800 kcal/day

Lifestyle: Dietary Plans for Weight Control (cont.)
• Meal replacements (1-2 meals/day)
 convenience, fixed calories, and inexpensive
 Protein shakes/bars, frozen entrees
• Meal delivery services
 Meal kits: Blue Apron, HelloFresh
 Prepared meals: Fresh Direct-under 500 cal meals, SunBasket
(customize: diabetes-friendly, Mediterranean, pescatarian, paleo)
●Very Low Calorie Diets (VLCD): ≤ 800 kcal/d
 Under medical supervision

Intermittent vs. Continuous Energy Restriction
Background: Long periods Continuous Energy Restriction (CER) w/wt loss
→ adaptive responses- incr appetite and decr EE → wt regain
Hypothesis: alternating periods of energy restriction w/energy balance will
block/attenuate adaptive responses → continued/incr wt loss
Intermittent Energy Restriction (IER) Patterns: freq & overall energy intake decr
Alternate-day fasting (ADF)- a “fast day” = absent or reduced intake, alternating w/
“feast” days=ad lib intake up to 125% calories
Time-Restricted (16/8 Method)- skip breakfast, eating period of 8 hours (i.e. 1–9
p.m.), fast for 16 hours.
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of IER Trials Lasting 6 Months or longer
8 trials included (n=981): 6 IER vs CER, 2 IER alone
Study lengths: 8 wks diet w/1 yr f/u - 50 wks diet w/ 2 yrs f/u
Results for Weight Loss: no diff b/t IER vs CER
Results for Metabolic parameters:
6 mos (1 study)- greater decr in insulin/insulin resistance in IER c/w CER
1 or 2 yrs (4 studies)- no sig diff in WC/TG/HDL-C/LDL-C/Gluc/Insulin/A1c

How to address the frequent comment…
“If I eat any less, I’ll be starving!”
In some regard, our patients are correct.
They may not be eating a lot of food but are eating too
many calories.
Unfortunately, we can’t program our bodies to stop us from
eating when we hit a set calorie level, but there are
strategies to eat less calories without sacrificing satiety
(feeling of fullness).
Total Ghrelin is Suppressed Strongly by Ingested
Proteins, Weakly by Lipids, and Biphasically by
Carbohydrates

Classification of foods for weight loss & satiety
Energy/Calorie Density (ED/CD): is the number of calories
(energy) in a specific amount of food per gram.
The 4 key components that affect ED are:
◦ Water (raisins vs. grapes)
◦ Fat (ice cream vs. lowfat yogurt)
◦ Fiber (broccoli vs. white rice)
◦ Air (popcorn vs. pretzels)
High ED means it contains a lot of calories per gram
Low ED means it contains less calories per gram
Medium Energy Density Food Low Energy Density Food
Raisins Grapes
 3.25 cals/g  0.69 cals/g
 1 tbsp of raisins (28g) has
about 90 calories
 A small bunch (100g) of grapes
has about 65 calories

Classification of foods for weight loss & satiety
Nutrient Density (ND): considers the whole nutrient
package of food and is calculated based on how many
nutrients per 100 calories.
(9 healthy nutrients- protein, fiber, vitamins A, C and E,
calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium)
High Nutrient Dense (HND): whole grains, fruits,
vegetables, dairy, lean proteins
Non-Nutrient Dense (NND): potato chips, white
bread/starch, soda, non-fruit juice, high fat proteins
Association of Nutrient-Dense Snack Combinations
with Calories and Vegetable Intake
Wansink et al. (2012) Pediatrics
 Children consumed 72% fewer calories when eating a combined
snack vs. eating chips. They also required significantly fewer
calories to achieve satiety vs. chip group.
Classification of foods for weight loss & satiety
Glycemic Load (GL)- a measure of foods that takes into
account both the amount of carbohydrate in the food and
the impact of that carbohydrate on blood sugar levels.
It’s derived from the glycemic index.
Classified into 3 categories:
◦ Low (10 or under)
◦ Med (11-19)
◦ High (20+)
Eating foods with a lower glycemic load can help reduce
overall calories and promote a feeling of fullness when
used to help patients eat higher quality carbs.
Classification of foods for weight loss & satiety
Insoluble Fiber-increases the water-holding capacity
of undigested food, which leads to increased bulk and
frequency of defecation
Improves constipation
Examples: Leafy greens, all berries, Fiber One
Soluble Fiber-forms gels, resulting in slowed GI transit
time
Helpful for constipation, diarrhea and high
cholesterol
Examples: Apples, oatmeal, legumes
Resistant Starch-is unable to be digested, reducing
the number of calories absorbed

Monitoring Progress
Measure body weight at visits:
-Practice empathy b/c “weighing in” can create anxiety and distress
-Factors that cause weight fluctuations:
Following a low carb diet; then binging on carbs
Eating a high sodium meal the evening prior
Not in a fasted state
Hormonally related water shifts
Follow metabolic/CV risk markers q3 or 6 mos:
Lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c
Monitor mobility/strength milestones:
Longer walking distance, able to complete more tasks w/o assistance
Monitor levels of joint pain:

Weight Maintenance
AKA: “Phase 2 of the Weight Loss Effort”
A crucial part of the weight loss process that is consistently
overlooked.
Further weight loss can be considered after 10% of initial body
weight is achieved and maintained for 6 months.
People typically hit a plateau around 6-12 months, with the greatest
weight loss at 6 months.
At this point the patient should have a “warning weight” within 3-5
lbs. of their current weight.
Remind patients of the “
energy gap
” for every 1 lb. lost, they burn ~8
kcal/day less; exercise critical
Hill, J et al. (2005)J Am Diet. 105;(suppl 1): S63-S66; Greenberg, I et al. (2009) J Am Coll Nutr, 28, 2:159-68.

Weight Maintenance cont.
AKA: “Phase 2 of the Weight Loss Effort”
Recommendations are for maintainers to participate in a longterm weight loss maintenance program with regular contact.
35-60% of adults with obesity who continue a high intensity long
term comprehensive lifestyle intervention maintain ≥5% weight
loss at ≥2 years.
Studies show more contact (at least 1x/month) leads to reduced
weight regain.
Most will regain 2 to 4.5 lb from the weight loss achieved at 6 mo
to 1 year when in a comprehensive program.

National Weight Control Registry
10,000 members
The average starting weight was 224 lbs. with an average 66
lb. kept off over 5 years. People lost weight through different
methods, but the strategies used to keep it off were very
similar.
89% initially lost weight by dietary changes and physical
activity; 10% used diet alone; 1% used physical activity
alone.
Only 9% kept off weight without physical activity.
95% reported a higher quality of life.

Checklist for Weight Maintenance Success
1. Follow a low-fat diet <30% calories from fat. Average
reported intake is ~1,400-1,800 kcal/day.
2. Move 60-90 mins or 11,000-12,000 steps/day at a moderate
intensity.
3. Eat breakfast every day.
4. Self-monitor by weighing weekly or daily.
5. Have a plan if weight increases a few pounds.

Nutritional Mgmt of Obesity Summary
•Multiple contributors to obesity
•Assess BMI, WC, comorbidities and readiness to change
•Begin a comprehensive lifestyle program with diet, behavior and exercise
modification and a goal of losing ≥ 5% TBW in 6 mos.
•Review macronutrient basics and choose nutritious eating plan
•Problems with increased hunger or wt plateau: concepts to maximize satiety
•Behavioral therapy can help with adherence
•Monitor progress at visits; pt monitors at home (scale, food logs, activity
trackers); functional parameters- walking distance, pain; labs- A1c, lipids
•Weight Maintenance- is an active process; have an active plan for weight
regain; physical activity is vital
Nutritional Mgmt of Obesity Summary (cont.)
● Be aware of and minimize weight bias/stigma
● Utilize full interprofessional team for best outcomes
● Role of providers:
 form a partnership with patients
 assist by offering tips and tools for success
 help remove roadblocks
 focus on pt reasons for weight loss, not # on scale
 celebrate patient efforts to improve health
 remember and remind patients, 5-10% weight loss can significantly
decrease CV risk factors (BP, lipids, glucose), improve mobility,
decrease pill burden

GHR class 1 cytokine receptor JAK/STAT pathway. Most of growth is
via IGF-1 . GHR abundant in liver, muscle and fat.
Effects of GH & IGF-I
Bone & Cartilage Metabolism
• Increased osteoclast differentiation and activity
• Increase osteoblast activity
• Increase in bone mass
Linear Growth
• Promotes epiphyseal growth
• Increased linear growth
Anabolism
• Increase nitrogen retention
• Increases amino acid uptake
• Increase protein synthesis
• Increased organ size
• Increases energy expenditure
Metabolic Effects of GH
• Directly mediated by GH
• In Liver: GH antagonizes
insulin-induced suppression of
hepatic glucose output.
• In muscle: GH inhibits insulinstimulated glucose transport.
• In Adipose Tissue: GH
causes lipolysis which releases free
fatty acids: FFA impair peripheral
glucose utilization.

AVP Makes the Collecting Ducts Permeable to Water
AVP binds to V2 receptor and increases cAMP, activates PKA, phosphorylates AQP2 and induces
fusion of the AQP channels with the plasma membrane.
Differentiate from Nephrogenetic DI and Primary Polydipsia.
Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): congenital, genetic and
acquired causes.
Acquired CDI caused by lesions that destroy AVP neurons NOT
the posterior pituitary that contains only axon terminals. Most
large pituitary tumors do not cause CDI.
Need destruction of 80-90% of AVP neurons to produce CDI.
The thirst center remains intact in most cases of CDI.
Adipsic CDI results when the thirst center is also damaged,
leading to dehydration and hyperosmolaltiy which is difficult
to mange.
Increased AVP metabolism during pregnancy can lead to DI.

Lactating Breast
• Compound tubulo-alveolar glands
• Thin stroma
• Parenchyma: glands (alveoli), ducts and
stroma
• Glands are filled with milk secretions
• Prolactin: stimulates glandular milk secretion
• Oxytocin: causes contraction of myoepithelial
cells – milk ejection
MAMMARY GLAND
Pregnancy - Activated Postpartum - Lactational
Alveoli developed, non secretory Alveoli secretory
NOTE: The body has 3 types of secretory glands:
1. Merocrine
2. Holocrine
3. Apocrine
The breast secretes milk.
THE BREAST IS AN APOCRINE SECRETORY GLAND!
The next 3 slides show you why & how
the breast functions as an apocrine gland.
3 Major types of secretory epithelium:
Membrane-bound secretions The whole cell is secreted Apex of cell is
are delivered into a lumen secreted
(salivary glds, pancreas) (sebaceous glands) (lactational breast)
Apocrine cells (e.g., lactating breast secretions)
Apocrine cells (e.g., lactating breast secretions)
Apocrine “snouts” from the surface
of the secretory cells break off to
form the breast milk
Events in Pregnancy and Lactation
1.Ovulation→corpus luteum secretes E + P
2.E+P stimulate growth of breasts
3.Estrogen stimulates GnRH from hypothalamus→anterior pituitary release
of FSH + LH
4.Estrogen stimulates release of Prolactin
from anterior pituitary
5.Lactational change in breast epithelium
is stimulated by Prolactin
6.After implantation of the blastocyst, the
outer cell mass gives rise to
trophoblast and secretion of HCG
occurs at 8 days after fertilization.
N.B.: Continued breast feeding
and prolacin production act as
a negative feedback on GnRH
release and therefore downregulate
FSH and LH production; however, it is
NOT a reliable form of contraception

Placenta Previa: risk of membrane/vessel compression Placenta accreta: risk of retaining necrotic tissue
Overview of 3 major
placental conditions
Abruptio Placentae
(retroplacental hemorrhage
or hematoma):
Risk of fetal/maternal
ischemia due to blood loss
Variants of abruption placentae (retroplacental hemorrhage)
decidua
myometrium
Placenta previa Abruptio placentae Placenta accreta
(retroplacental hematoma)
Pathogenesis:
Abnormal implantation Blood vessel rupture Deficiency of the decidua
Risk factors:
(surface for placental
implantation is scarred/loss of
decidua basalis )
-prior C-section
-prior endometrial curettage
-prior placenta previa
(placental villi adhere adhere to,
invade into or penetrate through
the myometrium)
(hematoma lies between and separates
the basal plate of placenta & uterine wall)
1. Maternal HTN & pre-eclampsia
2. ? Uterine vasospasm→uterine
arteriolar rupture
3. Cocaine use
(placental implantation in
lower uterine segment + some
placental tissue near or overlying
internal cervical os)
Complications: --Intrauterine fetal demise
--may lead to C-section
-placental infarction (but are often
small & inconsequential)
-prior C-section
-termination of pregnancy
by curettage
-cigarette smoking
- cocaine use
-painless antepartum
hemorrhage
-may lead to C-section
-antepartum bleeding
-uterine rupture (14%; in those
with “placenta percreta” & villi
invading through uterine wall)
-hysterectomy if bleeding severe
Abruptio placentae
(retroplacental hematoma)
Placenta Accreta
placental villi are
embedded within
myometrium (not in
decidua)→placenta
will not readily
evacuate at birth
Hydatidiform mole

Summary
Major Types and Biologic Behavior
Comparison of zygote development in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. In the uterus, a
majority of monozygotic twins (60–70%) share the same placenta but have separate
amniotic sacs. In 18–30% of monozygotic twins each fetus has a separate placenta and a
separate amniotic sac. A small number (1–2%) of monozygotic twins share the same
placenta and amniotic sac. Fraternal twins each have their own placenta and own
amniotic sac.
Twins
fraternal
Identical
Why should we study the placenta?
1. 26,000 stillbirths/yr. in U.S.: find out why these
occur.
2. Genomic DNA analysis of placental tissue shows
abnormalities in ~13-15% of stillbirths overall
(Reddy UM, NEJM, 2012) and up to 40% of 1st
trimester stillbirths (Carey, Transl Ped, 2015)
3. Antiphopholipid antibodies found in ~10% of
otherwise unexplained stillbirths (???? linked to
thrombotic events.)
4. Updated causes of stillbirths are identified by
pathologists skilled in placental pathology who
use a standardized examination approach.
Pinar H et al. Placental findings in singleton stillbirths.
Obstet Gynecol 2014; 123: 325-336.
Study of Placentas from 518 stillbirths:
--Chorioamnionitis: 30.4 % of stillbirths
--Vascular degenerative changes in chorionic plate: 55.7 %
--Retroplacental hematoma: 23.8 %
--Single umbilical artery: 7.7%
--Velamentous cord insertion: 5%
Abnormality in maternal decidua?
(e.g. vascular disease in diabetes, HTN,
smoking, drug abuse??)
Implantation abnormality
--placenta previa
--placenta accreta
--abruptio placenta
Umbilical cord abnormality
--single artery (nl.TAOV)
--nuchal cord (around
neck)
--infection (funisitis)
length: short / long

Golgi phase of
spermiogenesis
Multiple Golgi complexes (G)
accumulate.
Proacrosomal granules (Gr)
of these coalesce to form
the acrosomal vesicle (Ac).
This then spreads over the
anterior half of the nucleus
(N), forming the acrosomal
cap.

Portions of two spermatids (guinea pig) showing the intercellular bridges by which they are joined to
each other and to two other spermatids of the same cluster. The small arrows indicate the local
thickening of the cell membrane encircling the bridges. The large arrows passing through the bridges
indicate the sites of continuity of the cytoplasm from cell to cell. Acrosome is forming adjacent to
nucleus. Bloom, and Fawcett, A Textbook of Histology 10th ed., WB Saunders, Phil, 1975, p. 823.
Acrosome
Nucleus
Nearly mature sperm (mouse)
Nucleus (N), topped by the acrosome
(Ac). Two centrioles are involved in
the formation of the neck region.
One of these (Ce) initiates the
development of the long bundle of
filaments (C ) that is the core of the
middle piece and tail. The core has
an internal structure similar to a
cilium. The middle piece of the
flagellum is wrapped by a sheath of
mitochondria (M). The tail proper is
a fibrous sheath (FS) wound around
the axial filamenture. The asterisk
indicates a cellular bridge between
spermatids. Mitochondria (M),
